<h2 class="chap1">CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p>In the month of August, 1877, I found myself on board
ship, bound from Buenos Ayres for the coast of Patagonia,
in company with a party of engineers, who were
going to survey that portion of the country which lies
between Port Desire and Santa Cruz.</p>

<p>After leaving the River Plate we encountered adverse
winds and heavy weather, which kept us tossing about
for three weeks, without making any material progress
on our course. At last we got a fair wind, however,
which soon brought us close to our destination, the port
of St. Julian (lat. 49Â° 20&prime; S.); and one morning, together
with my five o'clock coffee, the cabin-boy brought me
the welcome news that land was in sight. I jumped
out of bed and ran on deck, careless of the hail and rain
which were falling in blinding showers, and of the wind
which blew off the land, far colder and sharper than we
had hitherto experienced. On looking to leeward, I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
could at first see nothing but a thick bank of clouds;
but presently the horizon got clearer, and I descried a
dark, lowering line of coast, of fierce and inhospitable
aspect, rising abruptly from the sea to a considerable
height.</p>

<p>I had not long to examine it, for a sudden shift of the
wind shrouded the whole coast in mist, and it did not
become visible again till the afternoon, when the weather
cleared up, and the sun shone out brightly. The wind,
however, slowly increased in violence; by the time St.
Julian came in sight we were plunging along under
reefed topsails, and the captain began to think that we
should have to stand off the port till the force of the
storm had abated&mdash;a prospect which threw us all into
dismay, as we had already been looking forward with
vivid expectations to the pleasure of stretching our legs
on <i>terra firma</i> the next morning&mdash;a luxury which those
who have made a long sea voyage can fully appreciate.</p>

<p>While the captain was yet doubtful what course
to take, the matter was summarily decided by the
weather itself. The wind, which had hitherto been
blowing from the north-east, shifted to the south-east,
and redoubled its fury; and rather than run the risk of
standing off the port for the night, under a lee shore
and with a strong current setting in to the land, the
captain elected to face the lesser danger, and enter the
port.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span></p>

<p>The necessary orders were accordingly given; a man
was sent aloft to look out for banks or rocks, and all
preparations were made for any emergency. An anxious
time ensued for all on board, as we steered slowly in
under the northern headland of St. Julian, menaced on
either side by steep and rugged cliffs, falling vertically
down to the water's edge; the sea dashing at their base
with an angry roar, and hurling the white spray almost
to their very summits. The gale howled through the
rigging, and a thousand sea-birds, startled at such an
unusual apparition, circled round the ship, white and
silent, seeming to eye us with an unpleasant curiosity.</p>

<p>Suddenly we heard a shout, "Breakers ahead!" and
everyone turned pale and looked anxiously forward.
Right in front of us, and forming a belt across the
entrance of the port, stretched a line of breakers, boiling
and foaming like a cauldron; while to the left a long
ledge of black, jagged rocks pierced through the waters,
promising certain destruction, should we drift upon
them. For a moment the captain was irresolute; but
it was too late to go back; in any attempt to put the
ship round we should have gone on the rocks, and there
was, therefore, no alternative but to continue our course
and dash through the breakers, leaving the rest to fate.
On we went, with beating hearts and strained nerves,
as the threatening roar of the foaming rollers became
louder and louder. In another second we were in their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
midst, and everyone held his breath in suspense. Suddenly
there was a shock; the ship quivered, and I was
thrown violently on my face. By the time I got to my
feet again, all danger was over. We had crossed the
harbour bar, and were now sailing slowly up the bay, in
comparatively smooth water, and congratulating ourselves
on our escape from what had looked a most
serious peril. The wind, too, had lulled, and by the time
we let go the anchor all was still and calm. The sun
was just setting; one by one the gulls, albatrosses,
and other sea-birds, which had hitherto been continuously
sweeping round the ship, disappeared; and
not a sound was heard from either side of the broad
bay.</p>

<p>On arriving in port, after a long sea voyage, the sudden
change of scene and associations, the bustle and
the noise of commercial activity&mdash;the steamers, lighters,
and other small craft, plying from shore to shore; the
ships moored alongside the wharves, taking in or discharging
cargo, the busy hum arising from the distant
town, the sight of new faces, and the sound of strange
voices&mdash;all combine to excite and bewilder one, contrasting
forcibly with the dull, quiet, and drowsy sameness
of the life one has just been leading during several
weeks of dreary navigation.</p>

<p>But none of these accustomed sights and sounds gladdened
our hearts in the desert harbour where we had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
just safely come to anchor, after our stormy passage.
The silence of death reigned everywhere, and its mysterious
effect, joined to the wild character of the surrounding
country, whose bold, bare hills were now
looming gigantic and black in the gathering dusk,
impressed me with a vague sense of awe and wonder.</p>

<p>And not out of harmony with the gloomy spirit of
solitude which broods over St. Julian, are the tragic
memories connected with the three famous nautical
expeditions which have visited its inhospitable shores.</p>

<p>We were anchored between two islands&mdash;Justice and
Execution Islands. These names were given to them by
Sir Francis Drake, who visited St. Julian in 1578. On the
former he caused one of his party, a Master Doughty, to
be put to death for alleged insubordination. Sir Francis
found a gibbet already erected on one of these islands,
which had been left there by Magellan, who passed the
winter of 1520 at St. Julian, and who, during his stay,
had also to quell a formidable mutiny which broke out
amongst his little fleet; and which, but for his timely
energy, foresight, and courage, might have ended fatally
for him. The ringleaders were executed. In more
modern times, another fatality occurred during the
expedition of the <i>Adventure</i> and <i>Beagle</i>, 1832. A
Lieutenant Sholl, a young officer of much promise, died
there, and was buried on a point overlooking the bay
which now bears his name. The spot is marked by a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
small cairn, bearing an inscription recording the date,
etc.</p>

<p>As I looked over the bay, for all the change that has
happened there since, either in the rugged outlines of
its shores or in the spirit of silence and desolation that
hangs over them, it seemed that it might have been but
yesterday that Magellan dropped anchor there, with his
quaint, high-pooped craft:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>'The first who ever burst into that silent sea.'</p>
</div>
<p>Peering into the darkness till a mist rose into my
eyes, I gradually fell into a half-dreaming, half-waking
state, and presently I seemed to behold some strangely
rigged vessels lying close to me in the bay. Magellan's
own ships! There was the tall, spare figure of the
intrepid commander himself, standing on the poop of
the largest vessel, dressed in a brown leather jerkin, the
cross-hilted sword at his side; and I could plainly mark
the expression of dauntless enterprise on his weather-worn
brow, and the determined gleam of his sharp grey
eyes, whose glance now wandered over the far shore
and now rested reverentially on the high cross fixed on
the poop. I could see the quaintly-costumed sailors
busy at work on deck, repairing rigging, mending
boats, or making sails, talking and shouting the while
in a strange tongue. Hardy, noble figures these men,
who, in the frailest of craft, braved a thousand dangers
in the wildest countries, and fearlessly carried the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
symbol of their religion to lands which mariners of today
with all the advantages of modern instruments and
superior vessels, approach with the utmost mistrust and
dread. Soon a bell rang, and all was silence; the men
left their work and gathered round the commander, who,
I thought, seemed to be addressing them. And then
floating over the waters came the sound of the 'Ave
Maria!' weirdly sweet and plaintive.</p>

<p>But at this juncture somebody shook me, and I woke
up, to find it was all a dream, and to remember that
Magellan had been dead and buried for centuries, and
that I, a son of the nineteenth century, had come to
that spot, not to plant the true Cross, but to find what
the country was capable of&mdash;and that, finally, it was
time for supper.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p>The next morning we were up betimes. The weather
was fine, and, as there was no wind, not too cold,
though the taller hills were covered with snow, and the
thermometer stood considerably below zero. Plenty of
sea-birds were flying round the ship, or disporting themselves
in the water, heedless of our presence; but on
shore there were no signs of animal life stirring anywhere.
Preparations were made for getting the horses
on shore as quickly as possible, as their long confinement
was beginning to tell injuriously upon them.
In the meantime a boat was lowered, and, taking our
guns, a few of us started off for the shore, to find some
suitable spot to land the horses, and to have a general
look round.</p>

<p>A short pull brought us in sight of a little cove, with
a strip of sandy beach leading up to the mainland, which
fell steeply down on all sides, so as to form a kind of
natural corral, where the horses would be quite safe and
conveniently sheltered from the wind. There we accordingly
landed, roughly waking the echoes, which had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
doubtless been comfortably sleeping for many a long
day, with a loud hurrah, as we jumped on shore and
climbed up the bluff which shut in the cove. There
the first object which met our sight was the little cairn,
already mentioned, commemorative of Lieutenant Sholl.
It was standing, probably, just as it had been left by the
hands which reared it, as the Indians seldom, if ever,
come so near to the port. The letters of the inscription
were still tolerably visible, for the stones suffer little
from the action of the atmosphere, and gather but few
mosses or lichens in that dry climate, where, during nine
months of the year, hardly any rain falls, and where all
vegetation is stunted and scanty.</p>

<p>The view we obtained from our present standpoint
was very limited, the horizon being bounded by a chain
of conically shaped hills, flattened at the top, and generally
similar in outline and height. The country which
they enclosed appeared to consist of a series of irregular
plains, broken up by glens, or 'caÃ±ons,' as they are aptly
called in Spanish, with here and there an isolated hill
and an occasional plain of short extent. There were
plenty of bushes of a thorny species scattered everywhere,
and in the glens the grass seemed to flourish in
tolerable luxuriance, though on the higher-lying land it
was less plentiful, the ground there being covered with
pebbles of porphyry, worn round and smooth by the
action of water at some remote period.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span></p>

<p>After our long cooping-up on board, we were not
equal to any prolonged exertion, and soon got tired of
climbing up the steep hills and escarpments, especially
as there was no employment for our guns, either in the
shape of beast or fowl. We therefore went back to our
boat, to get at which, as the tide had already fallen
considerably, we had to wade knee-deep through a long
tract of black, slimy mud. As there is a tide-range at
St. Julian of from thirty to forty feet, the ebb and flood
tides rush in and out with great rapidity, and we often
had great difficulty in pulling back to the ship, even
with four oars, when the wind and tide happened to be
against us.</p>

<p>The rest of that day was employed in getting the
horses on shore, a task which was successfully accomplished
before the tide commenced to rise again, so that
they had comparatively little distance to swim to the
cove. The poor animals seemed as glad as we had been
to find themselves on land once more, and testified their
satisfaction by neighing and frisking about with great
vigour. In the evening we made a short excursion to
Justice Island, close alongside of which we were
anchored. Whilst exploring it we startled a large
covey of shag, numbering quite a thousand, which, to
judge by the accumulation of guano, appeared to roost
there habitually. They did not fly up immediately at
our approach, but waddled clumsily down to the beach,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
holding their bodies quite erect, and flapping their
wings in a ludicrous manner. The sailors killed several
with sticks, and subsequently cooked and ate them, notwithstanding
the strong fishy taste of the flesh.</p>

<p>Early the next morning, together with two of my
companions, I started on an expedition towards the
interior, with a view to discover what kind of country
lay beyond the range of hills which bordered the horizon.
We took some provisions with us, as we did not
expect to be home till the evening, thinking it prudent
not to rely on our guns for our dinner, after the experience
of the previous day of the absolute absence of game;
indeed, we left them behind us, as being rather irksome
on horseback.</p>

<p>Mounting the three freshest horses we could find
amongst our stock, we struck off at an inspiriting gallop.
We had not gone far, however, before it came to an
abrupt ending. The plain over which we were riding suddenly
terminated, descending into a deep ravine, which
seemed to wind from the hills down to the port. The
descent was rather steep, but we got down somehow;
and then our horses had a hard climb up the opposite
side, rendered still more arduous by the loose nature of
the pebbly soil, which afforded no reliable hold, giving
way under their feet. On reaching the top, we found
ourselves on another plain, intersected a little further
on by a ravine similar to the one we had just crossed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
and so we continued, now scrambling up and down
these caÃ±ons, now leisurely trotting over short plains,
whose level surfaces gave our horses time to get
breath and to prepare for tackling the next ravine,
until gradually we got nearer to the hills, beyond
which we hoped to meet some more pleasant variety of
landscape.</p>

<p>Presently we came to a very broad caÃ±on, on the surface
of which we observed some irregularities, which, on
inspection, proved to be the remains of some human
habitation. Portions of wall, about three feet high,
were still standing, and here and there lay several
pieces of timber; but, excepting a millstone, half
embedded in the soil, there were no other vestiges of
those who had once attempted to create a homestead in
this lone spot.</p>

<p>The colony, on the site of which we were now
standing, was founded in 1780 by Antonio Viedma,
under commission from the Viceroy of the River Plate
Provinces, and was abandoned in 1784, in accordance
with a royal order, chiefly on account of the sterility of
the soil, which rendered agriculture impossible. The
colonists also suffered severely from scurvy, and were
further troubled by the Indians, whose hostility they
seem to have incurred. The Spaniards, whatever grave
faults they may have committed in the administration
of their South American possessions, developed great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
energy and spared no expense in their endeavours to
colonise Patagonia, and numerous expeditions were
despatched from Buenos Ayres with this object. Settlements
were established at Port Desire and other spots
on the coast, all of which, sooner or later, came to share
the fate of the colony of St. Julian.</p>

<p>And indeed it is not to be wondered at. Unless some
very cheap manure be discovered, by means of which
sand may be profitably fertilised, or unless some new
source of riches at present hidden be discovered there,
it is much to be apprehended that Southern Patagonia
is destined to remain almost entirely unpopulated and
uncultivated till the end of time. In the caÃ±ons, where
there is a little alluvial soil, some scanty crops might be
harvested, or a patch of potatoes might be cultivated;
but the spring and summer months are so dry, that even
these limited attempts at husbandry might not always
be attended with favourable results. Sheep might be
reared in the valley of the Santa Cruz River, though
not in great numbers, as the pasturage there is rather
limited, and the grass itself is coarse and long, and not
particularly adapted for sheep, for which it is preferable
that it should be short and fine.</p>

<p>The coast is extremely rich in fish, however, and a
dried-fish trade might, perhaps, be successfully carried
on with the Brazils, where a good market exists for this
article, which forms the staple diet of the poorer classes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
in that country. An attempt to start an industry of
this kind was made by a Frenchman, M. E. Rouquand,
who established himself, in 1872, at Santa Cruz, with all
the machinery, boats, etc., necessary for such an undertaking,
under a concession granted to him by the
Argentine Government. He built several houses and
sheds there, the materials for which were conveyed at
great expense from Buenos Ayres; and when everything
was ready, and he was about to go practically to
work, a Chilian man-of-war steamed into Santa Cruz
one day and signified to him that he was trespassing on
Chilian territory, and would be required to leave immediately.
Chili, it appears, claims jurisdiction over
Patagonia as far as Santa Cruz River, and could therefore
not permit anyone to attempt to benefit that
country whose authorisation to do so came from the
Argentine Government. The latter country does not
admit Chili's claims to possession over the territory in
question, but contented itself in this case with a diplomatic
protest against the act of violence committed in
defiance of the Argentine flag, under whose protection
M. Rouquand had laid out his capital and his energies.
In the meantime, M. Rouquand is of course ruined, as
neither Government has granted him any compensation
for the losses he has sustained by his arbitrary ejection.
After such an example, and as the settlement of the
territory dispute seems to have been indefinitely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
shelved by the easy-going countries concerned, it is
easy to understand why no one has hitherto been
found disposed to risk his time and capital in an
endeavour to establish any industry on the Patagonian
coast.</p>

<p>Turning our backs on the 'Glen of the Spaniards,'
as it is still called in Indian traditional nomenclature,
we again continued our journey towards the hills, which
were in reality much further than they had appeared at
first sight, being, by the rather roundabout road by
which we had come, about fifteen miles from the port.
Another hour's ride brought us to their base, and as the
keen morning air had made us all rather hungry, before
going any further we dismounted, and having made a
good fire with the branches of some of the thorny
bushes which abounded everywhere, and which proved
an excellent combustible, we discussed a hearty breakfast
of cold meat and biscuit.</p>

<p>After a short rest we remounted and rode slowly up
a glen which led between the hills, craning our necks
expectantly as we climbed the escarpment which
bounded its further end, from the top of which we
should have a good view of the surrounding country.
We emerged on the summit, and behold, there was
nothing but an immense plain, stretching away in
dreary uniformity to the far horizon. The scene was
not a cheerful one. Down in the caÃ±ons the grass is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
long and green, and clumps of underwood, growing at
intervals, lend a pleasant variety to the landscape.
But on the plains, which often extend uninterruptedly
for thirty or forty miles, all is different, and nothing
more dull and dreary can be imagined than the view
presented by these immense tracts of land, where, by
reason of the sterility of the soil and the fierce winds
which sweep continuously over them, no vegetation can
possibly flourish. The soil is sandy and covered with
stones, with here and there an isolated tuft of grass,
withered and grey, whilst a peculiar gloom is further
added to the melancholy of the scene by the sombre,
melancholy hue of a straggling, stunted bush, the jume,
which grows there in considerable quantities&mdash;in its
blackness and ugliness, the fit offspring of such an uncongenial
soil.</p>

<p>The plain we were now standing on was no exception
to the general rule, and we found but little inducement
to remain immersed in a long contemplation of its
charms; so, turning our horses' heads, we followed the
course of the hill range, which trended in a semicircle
towards the port. After having ridden for some distance,
the plain terminated, and we descended into a
broken country again, marked with the usual peculiarities
of glen and plateau. We presently came in sight
of a large lake, which we thought might contain fresh
water, but on coming closer we found that the shores
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
were covered with salt crystals, and that the soil in the
vicinity was impregnated with salt too. The lake
measured about two leagues long, by a league and a
half broad at the widest part, but the water was very
shallow everywhere. We could see a herd of guanacos
standing in the centre, and the water did not reach to
above their knees. I have frequently observed these
animals standing in the salt lakes which abound everywhere
in Patagonia, but whether they actually go to
drink I am not prepared to say, though it is hard to account
in any other way for their presence there. We
looked with some curiosity at these guanacos, as they
were the first animals we had met with as yet on the
mainland, but they were too far off for us to be able to
observe them with accuracy. I shall describe the
species at another opportunity.</p>

<p>In the meantime it was getting late, and our horses,
which had been severely tried by the nature of the
ground we had gone over that day, were beginning to
show signs of fatigue. My horse, in particular, was
completely done up, and it was with great difficulty
that I managed to keep up with my companions.</p>

<p>At sunset we were still a long way from the ship.
Dusk came on apace; the hills around us first grew indistinct
and hazy, and then gradually settled down into
a dark, solid mass, blackly defined upon the lighter
background of the sky, over which the stars were now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
glittering in the frosty air. It was getting cold, too,
and I began heartily to wish myself on board, especially
as every moment it became more apparent that my
horse was in imminent peril of collapsing altogether.</p>

<p>Still he stumbled on, occasionally shying wildly at the
glimmering whiteness of some heap of bleached guanaco
bones, or startled at the fanciful shapes assumed by the
bushes in the deepening shadows of night.</p>

<p>Presently, as I was riding up a rather steep escarpment,
my horse's saddle-girths slipped back, the saddle
rolled over, and I fell with a heavy thud to the ground.
The moment he felt relieved of my weight, and before
I could jump up and seize the reins, the horse turned
round and leisurely trotted back to a glen we had just
left, where there was some fine grass, which had
evidently taken his fancy in passing. I ran after him
as fast as I could, but he gently, though firmly, refused
to be caught, pausing now and then, whenever he had
distanced me, to snatch a few mouthfuls of grass, and
then starting off again as soon as I came near to him.
This kind of thing went on for a long time, and when
I had at last caught him, and had picked up the
various saddle-belongings, I was completely done up.
Not more so, however, than the horse, for when I
remounted him he refused to budge an inch, and at the
first touch of the whip, quietly lay down. I was now
in a pleasant plight. I shouted, in the hope that my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
companions would hear me, but no answer came.
They had evidently not noticed my mishap, and had
continued their route, thinking I was coming up behind.</p>

<p>Reluctantly I had to make up my mind to stop
where I was till the morning, though the prospect was
anything but cheerful. I was too tired to go on on foot,
and no persuasion would induce my horse to stir. I
was very hungry, and, unfortunately, one of my companions
carried what remained of the meat and biscuit;
and though it was extremely cold, I had no other coverings
for the night but my saddle-cloths, having neglected
to bring my fur robes with me. Luckily, I had a box
of matches; and having broken off a sufficient quantity
of dry branches from the bushes, I soon managed to
have a good fire burning, whose warm glow afforded me
no little comfort. As a substitute for supper, though it
was not a satisfactory equivalent, I smoked a pipe, and
then, wrapping myself up as well as I could in the
saddle-cloths, I lay down by the fire and tried to go to
sleep. This I could not accomplish; for although I fell
into a half-doze at first, as soon as the fire got low, the
cold thoroughly woke me again, and I had to set off and
look for a fresh supply of firewood&mdash;by no means a plentiful
article. I soon made the fire burn up again; but,
do what I would, I could not get to sleep, and finally
had to abandon the attempt as hopeless.</p>

<p>The night seemed interminable. Occasionally I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
would get up, and walk to and fro to pass away the
time quicker, but the cold soon drove me back to the
fire. I confess I should have liked some companion to
enliven my weary vigil. All alone in the wild desert,
surrounded by the dark night, I felt quite an uncanny
feeling come over me as I listened to the strange whisperings
which seemed to creep through the grass and
hover in the air, as the wind rose and swept down the
narrow glen where I was camping. The more I listened
the more these noises seemed to multiply, till at last
there was quite a Babel of confused sounds and vague
murmurings. Now and then I would start to my feet,
fancying I heard voices close to me, or something would
rustle mysteriously past, and a sound as of faint laughter
would seem to ring from out the depths of the darkness
around me. For a time I was kept in quite a
state of nervous agitation; but it gradually wore off,
and soon I became stolidly indifferent to everything
except the fire, to replenish which from time to time I
had to make an excursion in search of wood.</p>

<p>The hours went slowly by, as I sat watching the stars
creeping over the heavens, longing wearily for daybreak.
At last, worn out with fatigue, I fell into a troubled
slumber, and when I opened my eyes again the sky was
already grey with dawn. My fire had gone out, and
my limbs were stiff with cold. On a bush near where
I was lying four carranchos, a kind of hawk, were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
perched, eyeing me with a complacent, watchful look,
as if they expected shortly to make a meal of me. Feeling
quite uncomfortable under their unholy gaze, I flung
a stone at them; but they merely flew up a little, circled
once or twice round me, and then lighted again on
another bush, as much as to say, 'Never mind; we can
wait.' They abound in the pampas, and assemble in
great numbers whenever a puma slays a guanaco, as the
former often contents itself with merely sucking the
blood of its victim, leaving the rest to these birds and
the vultures, who soon pick the bones clean.</p>

<p>I rekindled the fire, and after I had warmed my
stiffened fingers, I saddled the horse, which I had tethered
to a bush during the night, and rode off towards
the port. I arrived at the cove after about an hour's
sharp riding, and found that my companions had also
been obliged to pass the night in the open air, as their
horses had eventually succumbed, under the fatigue
consequent on their hard day's work.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p>During the next few weeks we were busy examining the
country in the vicinity of St. Julian, without finding
anything of special interest to reward our pains. Near
the salt lake alluded to in the last chapter we discovered
some extensive deposits of phosphate of lime,
but as they are very far from the port, they must be
considered to have practically no commercial value.
Perhaps, however, when all the guanos and nitrates of
more accessible regions have been exhausted, the phosphates
of Patagonia may be utilised for manuring purposes,
but in the interests of agriculture it is to be hoped
that that day is as yet far distant.</p>

<p>St. Julian is a far superior harbour to either Chubut
or Port Desire, but there is a dearth of fresh water in
its vicinity during the months from October to June,
which is of course a great drawback, and neutralises its
other advantages. Indeed, the whole country is but
sparsely watered. South of the Rio Negro, which must
be considered as the dividing line between Patagonia
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
and the Argentine Provinces, there are only small
rivers, the Chubut, the Desire, and the Santa Cruz.
Coy Inlet and Gallegos rivers during nine months of
the year are unimportant streams, and the former at
certain periods frequently dries up altogether.</p>

<p>The river Chubut has never been followed to its source
by any trustworthy traveller, but Dr. Moreno, an Argentine
explorer, from personal observations and from information
obtained from the natives, is inclined to place
its source as taken from a lake, called ColuguapÃ© by
the Indians, which lies somewhere between lat. 44Â° to
45Â° S., and long. 68Â° to 69Â° W., Greenwich. Thence it
flows in a north-north-easterly direction till within
about sixty miles from its mouth, and then, having received
near this point the waters of several small streams
from the Cordilleras, it flows from west to east, and
finally empties itself into the Atlantic in lat. 42Â° 20&prime; S.
The depth of the river at forty miles from its mouth
varies from five to eight feet, according to the time of
the year. Its current is not so rapid as that of most
Patagonian rivers, but its extremely tortuous course
makes it difficult to navigate. Its estuary forms a
tolerably safe harbour for craft of light draught.</p>

<p>The Welsh Colony at Chubut, which numbers at present
about 700 souls, was founded by the Argentine
Government in 1865. It is not, and never has been,
in a flourishing state; but this is due not so much to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
the unfertility of the Chubut valley as to the fact that
most of the people sent out from Wales by the Government
agent to form the proposed agricultural colony
were miners, who of course knew nothing about farming
matters. For a great many years the colonists were
supported entirely by the Government, and on several
occasions when accidents had happened to the vessels
which were bringing stores for them from Buenos
Ayres, they were saved from starvation by the Indians,
who supplied them with guanaco and ostrich meat. At
present the prospects of the colony are rather more
hopeful: about 15,000 bushels of wheat were harvested
last year; but even now the colony is not self-supporting,
and costs the Argentine Government large sums
annually for provisions and other assistance afforded
the colonists.</p>

<p>South of Chubut lies Port Desire, formed by the
estuary of the river, or rather stream, of that name.
The Desire does not rise in spring and summer, like
Gallegos and the other Patagonian rivers, to any great
extent&mdash;a circumstance which makes it probable that it
does not take its source in the Cordilleras, but rather
from a chain of hills, which, according to Dr. Moreno,
traverses the centre of Patagonia, running south-southwest
from the Sierra de San Antonio, near the Gulf of
San Matias. The Spaniards formed a colony at Port
Desire, which, after having existed for a few years, was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
officially abandoned in 1807. The remains of a fort
and some houses are still standing near the port, as well
as some apple and cherry trees, with which the climate
of Patagonia seems to agree very well.</p>

<p>I pass over the incidents of the rest of my sojourn at
St. Julian, as having no relevancy to the object of this
work. Suffice it to say that by the little Government
schooner which makes two or three voyages annually
from Buenos Ayres to the Rio Negro and Santa Cruz,
and which on this occasion put into St. Julian to bring
us our correspondence, I received some letters, conveying
important news, which made my speedy return to
Buenos Ayres imperative. About the same time a party
of ostrich-hunters, attracted by the smoke of our fires,
came to St. Julian from Santa Cruz, partly out of
curiosity to see the unusual visitors, and partly to trade
for biscuits and tobacco. They did not stop long; and
as they were going back to Santa Cruz, and from there
to Sandy Point in the Straits of Magellan, where I
should be able to take a steamer for Buenos Ayres, I
embraced this favourable opportunity, and packing up
a few things, started off with my new acquaintances.</p>

<p>We had not gone far, however, when it commenced
to rain; and there being no particular object in getting
wet, we halted for the day, and took shelter under our
tent, hoping that by the next morning it would be fine
again. In this hope we were disappointed; it rained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
incessantly for about four days, during which we of
course remained where we were, and very tired I soon got
of it. The ground was as damp as could be, and so
loosened by the moisture that the stakes of our tent
gradually gave, and the slack canvas being no longer
water-tight, little pools of water gathered round the furs
and saddle-cloths which served us in lieu of bedding,
permeating them with a general dampness, which made
our nightly slumbers rather uncomfortable. The daytime
we passed cowering round the fire, with some
covering thrown over our backs to keep off the rain, the
front part of the body requiring no extra covering, for as
fast as it was wetted it dried by the fire, which for this
purpose was allowed to assume formidable dimensions.
Under such unfavourable circumstances, conversation
rather flagged, as may be imagined, being limited to
occasional prophecies and conjectures as to when the
weather might be expected to change for the better.
But in revenge, the tobacco-pipe and the matÃ©-pot went
round the circle without any intermission, and during
the days of forced inaction consequent on the rain, we
consumed startling quantities of those two almost indispensable
commodities of pampa life.</p>

<p>Yerba-matÃ© is a kind of tea in great repute throughout
South America, especially amongst the country
people, who drink it at all their meals, and whenever
they have nothing particular to do, which is very often.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
It is the leaf of a shrub (<i>Ilex Paraguanensis</i>) extensively
cultivated in Paraguay and the Brazils, constituting,
in fact, the chief article of commerce of the
former country. The powdered leaf is steeped in
boiling water, and imbibed through a thin pipe (<i>bombilla</i>),
perforated with holes, so as to prevent the fine
herb from being sucked up with the fluid. It has a bitter,
aromatic flavour, and though usually taken with sugar,
many find it equally palatable without the latter
adjunct. Its restorative powers are marvellous, and
frequently, when thoroughly exhausted after a hard
day's ride, I have taken a cup or two of matÃ©, and found
myself immediately revived and invigorated. It is
decidedly a better stimulant than either tea or coffee,
and as it does not seem to lose its flavour by exposure
to the air and damp as quickly as those articles do, it is
naturally preferred by those whose profession forces them
to take these qualities into account in the selection of
their victuals. MatÃ©, as I have already said, is indispensable
to the hunter in Patagonia. For months it
is often the only addition he can make to his otherwise
exclusively meat diet. In fact he is never without it,
except when in the saddest plight, and for its sake he
would forego any other luxury, such as sugar, biscuit, or
rice.</p>

<p>It is surprising that hitherto no attempt has been
made to introduce yerba-matÃ© into Europe as an article
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
of domestic consumption. It has only to be known to
be appreciated, and as it could be imported <i>pure</i>, far
cheaper than tea or coffee, it might in time prove a formidable
rival to those beverages, especially among the
working classes, to whom its invigorating qualities
would particularly recommend it.</p>

<p>Whilst the rain is pouring down upon us, I may as
well take the opportunity of introducing my four companions
to the reader. But first a few words as to their
common profession, that of the ostrich-hunter.</p>

<p>In the plains that stretch from lat. 40Â° to 53Â° S., and
from the sea-coast to the Cordilleras, the ostrich and the
guanaco roam in immense numbers, their procreativeness
being such as to more than neutralise the ravages
caused among them by their numerous enemies, such as
the Indians, the pumas, and the foxes. The Patagonian
ostrich is much smaller than his African cousin, and the
feathers are not nearly so valuable, the price usually
paid for them at Sandy Point being from $1 to $2
per lb. The trade of the ostrich-hunter is not, therefore,
very lucrative; but his wants, on the other hand,
are very modest. Besides, he follows his profession
more from a love of the wild pampa life, with its freedom
from irksome restraint and awkward social obligations,
than from any desire to amass wealth; more from a
necessity to satisfy his vagabond instincts, than from
any impulse derived from some definite aim in life. His
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
hunting-ground extends as far as he chooses to gallop.
His stock-in-trade consists of ten or twelve hardy
horses, five or six dogs of a mongrel greyhound species,
a lasso, a pair of bolas, a knife, a revolver, and a long
steel; besides, of course, all the necessary accoutrements
for his horse, which, together with the indispensable
capa, form his bed at night.</p>

<p>The capa is a long robe of guanaco furs, about five
and a half feet long, by four and a half broad. They
are made by the Indian women, who are very clever at
sewing, notwithstanding the primitive clumsiness of
their rude tools. Their needles consist of pieces of bone
sharpened to the requisite point, and the thread they use
is made from guanaco sinews. The skins are of the
young guanacos before they are three weeks old, as after
that time the fur becomes coarse and woolly. These
capas are extremely warm, and effectually protect one
from the cold winds that blow over the pampas, when
almost any other garment would prove insufficient. A
novice experiences considerable difficulty in the management
of their somewhat awkward folds, especially on
horseback; but the Indians wear them with infinite ease
and grace.</p>

<p>The bolas, or balls, are of two kinds, being either two
round stones or pieces of lead, covered with leather and
joined by a thong of from six to eight feet long; or
three balls, united by thongs to a common centre. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
latter are used chiefly for guanaco-hunting, and not a
little skill is required to handle them efficiently. After
having been swung round the head till the requisite
pitch of velocity has been attained, the balls are hurled
at the animal pursued, and becoming firmly twisted round
whatever part of its body they may fall on, they effectually
hamper its speed, and enable the hunter to come
up to it and give the <i>coup de grace</i> with his long knife.</p>

<p>With no other <i>impedimenta</i> than the above-mentioned,
the ostrich-hunter roams at will over the vast
pampas. At night-time he makes himself at home
under shelter of some thick bush, which, if such be his
caprice, may become his head-quarters for weeks, and
even months, especially if the game in the vicinity be
abundant. His movements are altogether uncertain,
and by no means regulated by any reference to time, to
the course of which he is sublimely indifferent. The
chase supplies all his wants. With the hide of the
guanaco he makes his lasso, reins, bolas, and even shoes;
whilst its flesh, varied by that of the ostrich, forms his
staple article of diet. When he has collected a sufficient
quantity of feathers, he pays a flying visit to Sandy
Point, sells them, and with the produce lays in a new
stock of tobacco and matÃ©, renews his wardrobe, <i>i.e.</i>, say
a shirt, a poncho, a jacket, and a chiripÃ ; and if there
still remains anything over, he may buy another horse,
or some dog which may have taken his fancy.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span></p>

<p>For the rest, he is a careless, easy-going vagabond,
always cheerful, whatever plight he may be in, and submitting
with calm philosophy to any of the many hardships
the inclemency of the climate may entail upon
him. There are, however, few Ostrich-hunters <i>pur
sang</i> in Southern Patagonia, though up near the Rio
Negro they are more numerous; but those one does meet
with are all distinguished by the characteristics I have
described.</p>

<p>I will now attempt a sketch of my four companions,
beginning with the most striking among them, Isidoro,
who is several times mentioned in Captain Musters'
interesting book, 'At Home with the Patagonians.' He
was an Argentine Gaucho, with a dash of Indian blood
in his veins, who had come down to Patagonia many
years ago from the Rio Negro. He was a slender, well-built
man, with a pleasant, swarthy face, of a warm,
earth-brown complexion, set in by a profusion of long
black hair, which he carefully groomed every morning
with a comb, whose teeth, being old, were decayed and
few and far between, kept for the purpose in the recesses
of a rather greasy cap. Broad and shaggy eyebrows,
meeting over a bold Roman nose and shading a pair of
bright, restless eyes, habitually veiled by half-closed
lids and the longest of lashes; slightly high cheekbones,
full thick lips, and a shaggy beard and moustache,
completed the <i>tout ensemble</i> of his really striking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
face, the general expression of which was one of intelligence
and good humour.</p>

<p>His dress, which combined materials of Indian as well
as European manufacture, was not unpicturesque, and
consisted of a woollen shirt and a 'chiripÃ '&mdash;a covering
for the lower limbs something like a kilt, secured by a
strap at the waist, into which were stuck the inevitable
hunting-knife, revolver, pipe, and tobacco-pouch&mdash;while
his feet were encased in potro boots, tied at the knees with
Indian-worked garters; and over all hung the long capa.</p>

<p>The recipe for making a pair of potro boots is very
simple, and the operation requires no previous knowledge
of the cobbler's art. Having killed your horse,
you make an incision with a sharp knife round the hide
above the hock, say at the commencement of the lower
thigh, and another a couple of inches below the curb-place,
and then proceed to draw the hide off the legs.
Each leg will thus supply a comfortable Wellington, in
which the point of the hock has become the heel. Of
course, before fit for wear, the hide must be well
softened by hand&mdash;a task which requires no little
patience; for if not thoroughly done, the boots after a
time will become quite hard and useless. As soon as
they have been worn long enough to have taken the
shape of the foot, the toe-ends are sewn up, and the
transformation of your horse's hocks into easy-fitting
boots is an accomplished feat.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span></p>

<p>When hunting, the belt and bolas are strapped outside
the capa, so that the upper part of the latter may
fly loose whenever any exertion requires that the
arms should be free, as when lassoing or throwing the
bolas.</p>

<p>Isidoro was one of the best riders I have ever seen,
and even amongst the Indians he was allowed to have
no equal. The most unruly colt became quiet in his
hands, and after a few ineffectual attempts to dislodge
its rider, would sullenly acknowledge the mastery of
his firm hand and easy seat. All his horses were wonders
of tameness and careful and intelligent teaching.
His method of taming them I subsequently had an
opportunity of studying, and in due course will revert
to it. He was equally proficient in the use of the lasso
and bolas, seldom, if ever, missing his aim. One of his
peculiarities was his extreme watchfulness; not the
slightest detail could escape his vigilance; and when
anyone, as often happened, would mislay a knife or
some such object, to save further trouble, Isidoro was
always appealed to as to its whereabouts, which he
would invariably point out immediately&mdash;the missing
article often lying under a bush or saddle-cloth, where
it had been thrown by its careless owner perhaps a day
or two ago. It seemed as if Isidoro made it his special
duty to look after everyone's things, though, to judge
by appearances, he never paid particular attention to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
anything except his pipe, which seldom left his mouth.
His sharpness of vision was intense, and he could detect
guanacos and ostriches on the far horizon, when I could
see nothing but bushes or clouds. Another distinguishing
feature was his taciturnity. Only on very rare
occasions have I heard him utter more than three or
four words at a breath, and often he would sit for hours
with the rest of us round the fire, listening attentively
to all that was said, without breathing a syllable the
whole evening. As the owner of some thirty fine horses,
he was considered quite a rich man amongst the Indians
and ostrich-hunters; and, on account of his honesty,
good-nature, and quiet, unassuming bearing, he was a
favourite with everyone.</p>

<p>We will pass on to Garcia, who, in appearance at
least, formed a striking contrast to Isidoro. His yellow
beard, brown hair, and blue eyes seemed to betoken a
Saxon rather than a Spanish descent. However, be that
as it may, he was a true Gaucho, and but slightly inferior
to Isidoro in horsemanship and general address as
a hunter. He had formerly been a soldier on the Argentine
frontiers, and in that capacity had had many a
fight with the Indians, thrilling accounts of which he
would often favour us with over the evening's fire.
Subsequently he had worked as 'tropero' (cattle-driver)
on the Rio Negro, a profession which in due course he
had relinquished in order to become an ostrich-hunter.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
Having lived more amongst civilised people, his manners
were less abrupt than Isidoro's, and he was rather
more talkative and genial than the latter.</p>

<p>Next comes Guillaume, who was by birth a Frenchman,
and who had originally been a blacksmith; but
some chance having wafted him to Patagonia, he had
taken a fancy to the country and remained there, and
was now fast becoming naturalised. He was an active,
intelligent fellow, and equal to any amount of hard
work. One of his most striking features was his enormous
appetite, the amount he could devour at one meal
being simply astounding. It is on record amongst his
companions that he demolished a whole side of a young
guanaco at a sitting. But notwithstanding this extraordinary
faculty for eating, he was as thin as could be,
and always had a hungry, half-starved look.</p>

<p>His very antithesis was Maximo, the last of the
group, who in size and corpulence might have competed
with the most Herculean Patagonian Indian. He was
an Austrian, age twenty, I think, and had formerly
been a sailor, but having been wrecked on the syren
shores of Patagonia, like Guillaume, he had been unable
to withstand its subtle attractions, and having embraced
the profession of ostrich-hunting, with the natural aptness
of sailors, he had soon mastered the mysteries of
his craft, and was already an adept in the use of lasso
and bolas. His strength was such as his burly dimensions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
warranted, and he would often surprise us by the
ease with which he would tear up firmly-seated roots,
and stout underwood for firing purposes. He was,
moreover, as I was surprised to find, an accomplished
linguist, and spoke Spanish, Italian, French, German,
and English with tolerable fluency, though I think he
could neither read nor write. His appetite, like Guillaume's,
was Homeric, the two being a host in themselves.</p>

<p>Maximo was not so rich as his companions; indeed,
his whole property consisted in a horse and a dog. The
former was a wiry little animal, and apparently impervious
to fatigue; for its owner was by no means a featherweight,
and it was a matter of continued astonishment
to me, how it managed to carry him along, day after
day, over tiring hilly country, with occasional fierce
gallops after ostriches, without ever showing signs of
distress. Neither was his attire so elegant or so comfortable
as that of his companions. It consisted, on my
first becoming acquainted with him, of a shirt and a
pair of trousers; boots he had none, but would now
and then wear a pair of sabots, made with the skin of
the hind-legs of the guanaco. However, the capa made
up for all defects in dress, and Maximo was perfectly
content with things as they were. Withal he was the
best-tempered fellow imaginable, and the stoic indifference
he showed to the discomforts of rain and cold,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
and his equanimity under all circumstances, were simply
heroic.</p>

<p>As these four men, who by various strange chances
had been thrown together on this desert spot, from such
different parts of the world, were to become my companions
during a long period of hardship and adventure,
I have described them at some length, especially as I feel
sure that their peculiar and utterly unconventional
mode of life, so different from that of the ordinary
people one meets in everyday intercourse with the
world, will invest them, in the eyes of my readers,
with the same romantic interest with which I regarded
them.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p>The rain continued to pour down almost without interruption
for four days, till one afternoon a shift of the
wind brought a definite change for the better; the clouds
cleared off, the sun shone out brightly, and we were
cheered by the sight of blue sky again.</p>

<p>We hastened to spread our furs, sheepskins, and
general clothing on the bushes to dry, as everything had
got more or less damp during the recent downpour, and,
thanks to the wind and sun, by supper-time we were
able to indulge in dry shirts and stockings again, which,
with the luxury of having dry beds to creep into that
night, in perspective, sent up our spirits a hundred
degrees, and made the conversation over that evening's
supper as lively as it had hitherto been dull.</p>

<p>Maximo told the story of the shipwreck which had
first thrown him on Patagonian shores; Garcia related
some exciting incident of his frontier warfare experience;
Guillaume recounted the hardships and dangers he had
undergone during the siege of Belfort in 1870, having
belonged to the brave garrison which defended that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
fortress; and even Isidoro, yielding to the genial influence
of the moment, so far abandoned his accustomed
silence as to tell us how, when a soldier in the Argentine
service at Rio Negro, he had deserted and run away
with a tribe of Tehuelche Indians, who were going
south, with whom he lived for a long time, and from
amongst whose brown-skinned daughters he had eventually
taken unto him a wife. He admitted, however,
that his matrimonial existence had not been a happy
one. Mrs. Isidoro, it appears, took to drinking, and
became too noisy and violent for her husband, who of
all things loved quiet; so without any further fuss, and
without many words, as was his custom, he led her back
to her father's tent, where, with a short explanation, he
left her, thus consummating his divorce <i>a mensÃ¢ et
thoro</i> with expeditious ease, and securing for himself the
blessing of undisturbed peace for the future.</p>

<p>We rose at daybreak the next morning, and commenced
preparations for starting. The horses, some
fifty in number, were driven together; those selected
for the day's work were severally lassoed, and this being
done, the others were allowed to disperse again and
return to their grazing, whilst we got ready.</p>

<p>Although as tame as cats in every other respect, very
few of these Indian-tamed horses allow one to approach
them on foot; as a rule they can only be caught with
the lasso. When a horse observes that it has been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
singled out from the herd for capture, it does its utmost
to evade the flying noose, and often gives a great deal
of trouble before it can be finally caught; but the
moment it feels the lasso alight round its neck, it will
stop short in the fiercest gallop, and immediately gives
up any attempt at resistance, which it knows would be
useless; and when once it is bridled, the lasso may be
removed, and it will stand in the same spot for hours,
without attempting even to graze.</p>

<p>Our stock of provisions, viz. some rice, biscuit, farina,
sugar, matÃ©, and a stone bottle of gin, were carefully
packed up, and together with the tent and cooking
utensils, an iron pot, a saucepan, and a tin kettle, were
placed on the pack-horse, a sturdy animal, who trotted
away under his load as if it had been a feather-weight.</p>

<p>We then commenced saddling our own horses&mdash;a
somewhat lengthy operation. The articles which constitute
the saddle-gear of a horse in the pampas are
rather numerous, and at night-time serve, with the aid
of the capa, as mattress, bed-clothes, and bedstead.
First one lays two or three blankets or cloths, folded
square, on the horse's back, taking care that they lie
smooth and form no creases; over these comes a covering
of leather, called a 'carona,' which consists of two
thick pieces of leather sewn together, and which is very
useful at night-time, as it forms a damp-proof foundation
for one's bed. On the carona the saddle is placed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
and firmly secured to the horse by means of a broad
leather girth, and over the saddle again are laid the
sheepskins, furs, or whatever coverings one may possess.
All being ready for starting, we strapped our capas well
around us, a few logs were heaped on the smouldering
fire, we warmed our hands, which had got stiffened with
the cold whilst saddling, smoked a last pipe, and after a
look round to see if anything had been forgotten, jumped
into the saddle, whistled to the dogs, and we were off, <i>en
route</i> for Santa Cruz.</p>

<p>It was a bright morning. The wind was just cold
enough to make one feel grateful for the warm sunshine,
and to give that exciting tingle to the blood which
influences one's spirits like a subtle wine. I felt its
power, and a strange elation made my pulse beat
quicker, as I rode gaily along, inspirited by the strong,
springy step of the good horse I bestrode, and inhaling
deep draughts of the pure clear air, which seemed to
sweep the cobwebs of care from my brain, and to blow
all unpleasant thoughts far from me, making me feel
gloriously happy in the mere consciousness of the fact
that I breathed and had being.</p>

<p>I seemed to be leaving the old world I had hitherto
known behind me, with its turmoils and cares and
weary sameness, and to be riding merrily into some
new sphere of free, fresh existence. I felt that without
a pang I could break with old associations, renounce
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
old ties, the pomps and the pleasures, the comforts, the
bothers, the annoyances of civilisation, and become as
those with whom I was now travelling&mdash;beings with no
thought for the morrow, and therefore with no uneasiness
for it either, living the life of our nomadic ancestors,
in continual and intimate contact with nature&mdash;an unchequered,
untroubled existence, as wild, simple, and
free as that of the deer that browse on the plains.</p>

<p>We were riding along a broad glen, down the middle
of which a rapid stream was flowing. Guillaume and
Maximo were busy driving the horses before them&mdash;no
easy matter, as, now and then, one or two would lag
behind to crop up a mouthful of grass, or the whole
troop would make a dash in the wrong direction, only
to be got together again after much galloping and shouting.</p>

<p>The neighing of the horses, the continual cries of
'Jegua! Jegua!' with which they were urged along,
and the tinkling of the bells on the 'madrinas' (bell-mares),
broke cheerfully on the silence of the glen, and
startled many a flock of wild geese, who were disporting
themselves there in numbers; and occasionally a
guanaco or two, who had been grazing in the young
grass, would gaze at us in a momentary fit of curiosity,
and then bound away with their graceful, springy gallop,
neighing defiance at us as they glided swiftly up the far
ravine.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span></p>

<p>After we had gone some way, Isidoro and Garcia and
myself rode ahead of the horses, in order to look out for
ostriches, Isidoro taking one side of the caÃ±ada, which
was about a mile and a half broad, and Garcia and myself
the other. I felt very excited, as it was my first
hunt after this kind of game. The dogs, with erect and
quivering tails, and noses down, were eagerly running
this way and that, scenting the ground, or snuffing the
wind which came in light puffs down the caÃ±ada.</p>

<p>Presently they made a simultaneous dash forward, and
started off after something, and my horse, evidently an
old hunter, with a sudden start that almost threw me
out of the saddle, dashed after them, <i>ventre Ã  terre</i>, like
wild-fire, side by side with Garcia, who was already
loosening the bolas to prepare for action.</p>

<p>I soon descried the ostrich, which was hurrying along
as fast as its legs would carry it, wings drooping and
neck outstretched, with the whole covey of dogs close on
its heels. The race was at first doubtful, but a moment
of indecision brought the ostrich into difficulties, and
the dogs slowly gained on their prey. Already the foremost
one was up to it, when the ostrich suddenly darted
sideways, whilst the hounds, unable to stop their
impetuous speed, shot forward a long way before they
could recover themselves. By that time the bird was
half-way up the side of the glen, and out of danger;
and Garcia whistled to the dogs, who came back slowly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
and sulkily, with their tails between their legs, looking
wistfully over their shoulders at the retreating bird,
which was already a mere speck on the summit of the
ravine.</p>

<p>Garcia told me that the ostrich, like the hare, often
resorts to this trick of 'doubling' when hard pressed. It
is not always as successful as it had been in the present
case, as the dogs generally know the exact moment
and in what direction the ostrich is going to double, and
are prepared accordingly.</p>

<p>We were riding slowly along, talking about our late
disappointment, when another ostrich started up almost
from under our very feet. With a wild shout we
dashed after it, Garcia getting ready with the bolas, now
our sole means of capturing the bird, as the dogs had
lagged far behind us on some wrong scent. The horses
were on their mettle, and in headlong chase we tore
after the distressed quarry; but though we strained
every nerve, we could not gain an inch of ground, and
in another second we should have lost the ostrich, who
was making for the steep ravine-side, when Garcia
swinging the bolas two or three times round his head
flung them with strong hand at the retreating bird.
Luckily lighting on its neck, they entangled its legs
and it fell to the ground kicking desperately. An instant
after and we were up to it, and Garcia ended
its struggles by breaking its neck, and then proceeded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
to disembowel it&mdash;a process watched with peculiar
interest by the dogs, the offal, etc., being their share of
the spoils.</p>
<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_051.jpg" width="550" height="341" alt="" />
<p class="caption">OSTRICH HUNTING.<br />

<span class="s08"><a href="#Page_50">p. 50</a>.</span></p></div>

<p>The trophy was then hung to Garcia's saddle, and we
went back on our tracks to look for the nest; for, from
the bird having started up so close to us, Garcia surmised
that it must have been sitting, as during that
period they are loth to leave their nests, at the approach
of danger, till the very last moment. Garcia proved to
be right, for, after a short search, we came upon the
nest, which contained fourteen eggs&mdash;a prize we were
not long in securing to our saddles.</p>

<p>I found the nest to be of the roughest description,
being simply a hole scooped in the ground, under shelter
of a bush, and made soft for the young chicks by a few
wisps of grass.</p>

<p>The number of eggs found in a nest varies from ten
to forty, being usually about twenty. In size the Patagonian
ostrich's egg is equal to about eight hen's eggs.
It is the male bird that hatches the eggs and looks after
the young&mdash;being, I believe, the only male among birds
which does so. The period of incubation is from twenty
to twenty-four days. During rainy weather he never
leaves the nest, but will sit for six or seven days without
feeding. In fine weather he grazes for an hour or two
in the evening, but never strays far from the nest, as
Master Reynard, who is always prowling near, would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
soon make a raid on the eggs. It is said that if one egg
is broken or abstracted from the nest during the absence
of the male bird, on returning he will immediately detect
the theft, and become so furious that he will dash the
remaining eggs to pieces, and dance round the nest as if
frantic.</p>

<p>After the hatching period, the birds lay their eggs
promiscuously about the plains. These eggs are called
'huatchos' by the natives. They keep for a long time,
and I have frequently met with huatchos in April, which,
although they must have been laid more than six months
at that time, were still fairly eatable.</p>

<p>The ostrich of Southern Patagonia (<i>Rhea Darwinii</i>)
is smaller than the 'Avestruz moro' (<i>Rhea Americana</i>),
as the species which frequents the country near the
River Negro is called by the natives. The colour of its
plumage is brown, the feathers being tipped with white,
whereas the moro, as its name indicates, is uniformly
grey. The <i>R. Darwinii</i> are extremely shy birds, and as
their vision is remarkably acute, it is by no means an
easy matter to catch them, unless one has very swift
dogs to hunt with.</p>

<p>At the approach of danger the ostrich often crouches
flat on the ground, with its neck stretched out under the
grass, remaining motionless in this position till the dogs
have gone past. This stratagem is successful when
the wind is blowing against the scent; but when the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
contrary is the case, the dogs soon discover the hiding
bird, which, doubtless too bewildered by the sudden
failure of its naÃ¯vely artless ruse, makes no attempt to
escape.</p>

<p>Our companions by this time were a long way ahead
of us, so we started after them at a brisk gallop. On
the way we met Isidoro, who had also been fortunate,
as two ostriches dangling from each side of his saddle
evinced.</p>

<p>We continued our journey along the winding ravine,
all helping now to drive the horses and keep them well
together&mdash;an essential matter when rapid progress is
desirable, for if the troop once gets broken up and scattered,
one may spend no end of time in galloping about
and herding the horses together again.</p>

<p>At about five o'clock we passed a fine thick bush, of
considerable height, which appeared so well adapted for
affording shelter, that we resolved to camp under it for
the night, especially as I, not being accustomed lately
to such long rides, already began to feel rather tired and
shaken.</p>

<p>In a few minutes after we had made this decision our
horses were unsaddled, the saddle-gear, packs, ostriches,
etc., thrown higgledy-piggledy in a heap, and everyone
lay down in the grass to stretch his limbs and smoke a
pipe&mdash;a simple indulgence which, under such circumstances,
becomes an absolutely priceless luxury.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span></p>

<p>A small fire was then made, the kettle filled from the
rivulet which ran down the centre of the ravine, and as
soon as the water boiled, matÃ© was prepared, and we sat
for some time silently imbibing that stimulating concoction,
whose wonderful powers of banishing fatigue I
have already alluded to.</p>

<p>Presently Maximo and Guillaume went off to collect
firewood, whilst Isidoro and Garcia busied themselves
with plucking the ostriches and laying the feathers in
bundles, in which form they enter the market. I
stretched myself out on my furs and awaited the dinner-hour
with eager expectation, as my ride and that sharp,
dry air peculiar to Patagonia had given me the real
pampa appetite, under the influence of which one becomes
so inordinately and irksomely ravenous, and
experiences such an unnatural craving for food, as quite
to justify one in considering one's self attacked by some
transitory, but acute disease which has to be undergone
by the stranger in Patagonia, like those acclimatising
fevers peculiar to some tropical countries.</p>

<p>In an hour or so Guillaume and Maximo returned,
bringing a huge bundle of dry wood between them, and
the kitchen being Maximo's special department, he immediately
set about getting dinner ready. Thanks to
his efforts, a fine fire was soon blazing; the big iron pot
was filled with water, ostrich meat, and rice, and set to
boil, and several other dainties were set to roast on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
wooden spits or broiled in the ashes, emitting odours of
grateful promise as they sputtered and browned under
Maximo's delicate handling.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, we sharpened our knives, took up comfortable
positions round the fire, and the <i>chÃªf</i> having
declared everything ready, the onslaught commenced.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_056.jpg" width="550" height="385" alt="" />
</div>

<p>I append the <i>carte</i> for the benefit of those curious in
such matters:</p>
<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p><i>Pot-au-feu</i> (rice, ostrich meat, etc.).</p>
<p>Broiled ostrich wings.</p>
<p>Ostrich steak.</p>
<p>Cold guanaco head.</p>
<p>Roast ostrich gizzard, <i>Ã  l'Indienne</i>.</p>
<p>Ostrich eggs.</p>
<p>Custard (ostrich eggs, sugar, gin).</p>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span></p>

<p>A glance at the above will show that a pampa dinner
may be pleasantly varied. Of the items mentioned, I
think the ostrich wings are the greatest delicacy,
tasting something like turkey, and, as I then thought at
least, perhaps even finer. The ostrich gizzard, too, was
worthy of note, being broiled Indian fashion, with hot
stones&mdash;a task which, as requiring great care, was
superintended by Isidoro himself, who in his way was
a remarkable cook. The flavour of ostrich meat
generally is not unpleasant, especially when fat. It
varies greatly, according to what part of the bird it is
from. The wings, breast, and extremity of the back
are the tit-bits. The thighs are coarser, and bear a
close resemblance to horseflesh.</p>

<p>When all the meat was consumed, Isidoro, who, by-the-bye,
seemed to be able to produce anything that was
required from somewhere or other (generally from his
cap, which was quite a storehouse for all kinds of extraneous
articles), now turned up with a small soup-plate
and a dilapidated spoon, and I was requested to
help myself to the broth and rice in the pot, handing
the plate back to Isidoro when I had finished, who in
his turn passed it to Garcia, and so on till it had gone
round the circle.</p>

<p>We then lay back to smoke and recover from our
exertions, whilst the dogs cleared up whatever fragments
remained from the feast.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span></p>

<p>Here I may say a few words about the dogs, of which
there were in all about eighteen with us. Most of them
were greyhounds, of more or less pure breeds, imported
by the Welsh settlers at Chubut; the others being
nondescript curs of heavier build, which were useful for
pulling down the guanacos brought to bay by the fleeter
but less powerful greyhounds. Their various merits
and failings formed the usual topic of an evening's conversation,
their owners comparing notes as to their
respective achievements during the day's hunting, or
recalling previous wonderful performances worthy of
remembrance.</p>

<p>We were quite overrun by such a number of dogs,
and often they became a nuisance only to be borne
when we remembered that after all they were the meat-givers,
without whom we should find ourselves in a
very unpleasant plight. They had a peculiarly happy
knack, when wet, of creeping into one's furs, and
making one's bed damp for the night; and often I have
been awakened by one of them trying to go comfortably
to sleep on the pillow beside me, and thrusting its cold
nose into my face as a preliminary. When eating, if I
happened to lay down a piece of meat for a moment, it
was sure to be immediately snapped up by one of them,
and they would even snatch away the morsel held in
my hand, if I did not take care to keep them at a safe
distance. All provisions had to be put on the top of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
bush, well out of their reach, as neglect in this particular
might bring on the unpleasant alternative of going supperless
to bed.</p>

<p>We sat for some time round the fire, chatting and
smoking, and then each looked out for his furs and bed-gear,
arranged his couch, and before long we were all
fast asleep.</p>

<p>I woke once, roused by some horse which had
strayed from its companions, and which was snuffing
at me curiously, till on my starting up it bounded away,
snorting with terror.</p>

<p>Before going to sleep again I looked around me.
There was a faint scent of fresh earth on the cold night
air, and a slight frost had fallen over bush and grass,
which told that dawn was not far distant. The moon
was shining full over the valley, bathing it in hazy
light. I could see the horses standing about in black
knots of twos and threes, some dozing, some grazing, the
bells of the madrinas occasionally breaking the deep
silence with a soft tinkle. Round the fire, some logs of
which still smouldered redly, my companions lay
motionless, sleeping soundly under cover of their warm
furs.</p>

<p>Fascinated by the strange novelty of the scene and
the calm silence of the hour, I lay for a long time gazing
about me. I watched the soft charm of silvery indistinctness,
lent to the landscape by the moon's rays
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
glittering on the frosty crystals, gradually fade away,
as the moon's splendour paled before the new light
which sprang up in the east. Soon the bushes, the
grass, and the winding ravine stood out sharply defined,
looking grey and bleak in the sober light of dawn. The
face of nature seemed blank and wan, like the face of a
man on whom the morning light streams after a night
of vigil. With a shiver I drew my head under my
capa, and fell into a sound sleep again.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p>When I awoke there was a good fire crackling and
blazing cheerfully, and I lost no time in getting up and
joining my companions, who had already risen, and were
taking matÃ© and enjoying the warm glow of the fire,
which at that damp, chilly hour was indeed welcome.</p>

<p>As we were not going far that day, we were in no
hurry to start off, preferring to wait till the sun should
get high enough to dispel the cold mist which hung
over the country.</p>

<p>We took our ease over breakfast, therefore, and it
was already nearly midday when Maximo rode down
the ravine to collect the horses. We waited for a long
time, but, to our surprise, he did not reappear, and presently
Garcia went after him to see what was the
matter. After a time they both returned, driving the
horses before them, but reporting Isidoro's stallion and
several of his mares missing. From the appearance of
the tracks, Garcia seemed to think that some wild
stallion had made a raid on the mares and driven them
off&mdash;a piece of news which filled Isidoro with consternation,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
as he feared that by that time the missing
animals might be forty or fifty miles away, beyond any
hope of recapture. Without losing any time, therefore,
we all saddled; and leaving some of our gear and
packages under the bush where we had been camping,
we started off on the trail.</p>

<p>Some way down the caÃ±on we came to a place where
there had evidently been a fierce struggle. The ground
was torn up in all directions, and Isidoro's sharp eye
was not long in detecting some tufts of hair lying in the
grass, which he declared came from the coat of his own
bay stallion. Some of the hoof-marks were very large&mdash;larger
than could have been made by any of his horses&mdash;and
he quite confirmed Garcia's surmise, that some
'bagual' (wild horse) had carried off the mares, after
having previously fought and vanquished his own
stallion. We had no difficulty in following the trail, as
the recent rain had made the ground quite soft. The
tracks went along the caÃ±on for some distance, and
then suddenly turned and went up the caÃ±on-side on to
the plain. We had not gone far over the latter when
our horses pricked up their ears and began to sniff the
air in a nervous manner. A few strides more brought
us to the edge of the plain, and in the caÃ±on at our feet
we discovered Isidoro's bay stallion, looking very crestfallen
and wobegone. At our approach he gave a faint
neigh of satisfaction; but he had hardly done so, when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
it was answered by a triumphant pÃ¦an from another
quarter, and from behind a bend in the caÃ±on, meekly
followed by Isidoro's mares, issued a magnificent black
stallion. Undeterred by our presence, he made straight
for his but recently vanquished rival, with head erect
nostrils distended, and his long mane and tail streaming
in the wind. As for the bay,</p>

<div class="blockquot">
	<p>'Not a moment stopped or stayed he;'</p></div>

<p>but ignominiously took to his heels, and started up the
caÃ±on at full speed.</p>

<p>Isidoro, who was some way ahead of us, galloped
to the rescue. The bagual, strange to say, however,
suddenly rushed at him, standing upon its hind-legs, and
beating the air with its fore-feet in a threatening
manner. Taken by surprise, Isidoro had hardly time to
loosen his bolas when the furious brute was upon him,
and for a moment I thought it was a bad case. But
Isidoro was as cool as he was adroit, and in another
second the bagual dropped on its knees, half stunned,
struck full in the forehead by a well-aimed blow of
the balls. Before it could recover, Garcia's lasso
whizzed through the air and lighted on its neck, and
then, setting spurs to his horse, he galloped away at full
speed in an opposite direction. The shock, as the lasso
tautened, threw his horse on its haunches, but the
stallion lay half strangled and powerless. To finish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
matters, Maximo whipped his lasso over its fore-feet,
and drew them tight together, and the poor brute was
thus reduced to utter helplessness.</p>

<p>We could now contemplate it at our ease. It was a
splendidly-made animal, and far larger than any of the
horses of our troop. I was very much astonished at the
way it had shown fight, as I had imagined that, being
wild, it would have fled at the sight of man. I pleaded
strongly that its life might be spared, but the fact that
it was in very good condition weakened the force of any
argument I might bring in support of my plea, fat meat
in spring being a luxury which my companions did not
feel justified in depriving themselves of, if fate chanced to
throw it in their way. The poor bagual was accordingly
despatched, skinned, and cut up; but eventually none of
the meat was eaten, for, much to everyone's disappointment,
it proved so strong that even the dogs did not
care to touch it.</p>

<p>We now returned towards our camp. The bay stallion,
his wrongs avenged and his abducted wives restored to
his affectionate keeping, kept neighing and tossing up
his heels in a state of high glee, without, to all appearance,
being troubled by any misgivings as to whether
his recent ignominious defeat had caused him to forfeit
the esteem of his family circle.</p>

<p>On our way back, Isidoro told me that he had frequently
seen troops of wild horses near St. Julian, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
that at times the Indians make excursions to those
regions on purpose to catch them. At the foot of the Cordilleras
there is a smaller, and in every way inferior, breed
of baguals, several tame specimens of which I subsequently
saw amongst the horses of the Southern Tehuelches.</p>

<p>Having reached the camp, we loaded the pack-horse,
and resumed our journey southwards. We continued
to follow the windings of the ravine for some distance,
and then, turning abruptly, we rode up one of its steep
sides, and found ourselves on a broad plain, which
seemed to stretch away interminably, presenting the
characteristics of dreary gloom and hopeless sterility I
have already described.</p>

<p>The wind, which down in the ravine we had scarcely
felt, blew with astonishing violence upon the plain; the
gusts were so strong occasionally that we could hardly
keep our saddles, and at intervals we encountered squalls
of hailstones of unusual size, which, coming full in our
faces, caused us no little annoyance. It was bitterly
cold, too, and I was thankful for my capa, which kept
me tolerably warm, though I had great difficulty in
keeping it tightly folded round me, for if the wind
could but find hold in the smallest crevice, it would
blow the capa right off me. In fact, it requires a
peculiar knack, only to be attained by long experience,
to enable one to wear a capa on horseback with ease
and comfort.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span></p>

<p>Conversation under these adverse circumstances was
not very practicable, and we rode on for the most part
in silence. It was altogether a miserable day, and
that tedious plain seemed as if it were never going to
end.</p>

<p>We reached its limit rather suddenly, however. I
had been holding my head down for some time, to avoid
a passing squall of hailstones, and so had fallen insensibly
to the rear of my companions. On looking up
presently, I found, to my astonishment, that they had
vanished as if by magic, and I was apparently alone in
the plain.</p>

<p>I galloped forward, and their sudden disappearance
was soon explained, for in a couple of minutes I found
myself at the edge of the plain, which terminated
abruptly, descending almost vertically into another
plateau, which lay some two hundred feet below, down
towards which my companions were slowly winding
their way in a zigzag line, as the descent was too sharp
for them to ride straight down. I had considerable
difficulty in following them, as the violence of the wind
seemed doubled at this spot, and it was only by clinging
firmly to the neck of my horse that I prevented
myself being blown from the saddle. In a measure as
I descended, however, the wind grew less boisterous,
and on arriving below it entirely ceased. I soon rejoined
my companions, and presently, on coming to a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
spring of fresh water, with some good pasture near it
for the horses, we resolved to go no further that day.</p>

<p>We accordingly unsaddled and made the usual arrangements
for the night, which, as the sky looked
rather threatening, on this occasion included setting up
the tent. This precautionary measure was a wise one,
as towards morning there was a slight fall of snow, and
when I woke up I found the whole landscape whitened
over.</p>

<p>Garcia and the others were of opinion that we had
better remain where we were for the day, as they considered
that travelling through the snow might be bad
for the horses; so, there being nothing better for us to
do, we crept under our furs and went to sleep again till
about midday, by which time the snow had nearly all
melted away under the influence of the sun, which
shone out brightly. Isidoro and Garcia then rode off
hunting. Maximo, Guillaume, and I, being lazily inclined,
remained by the fire, and beguiled an hour or so
with breakfast.</p>

<p>Afterwards they went to fetch firewood, whilst I
amused myself by practising with the bolas. I found
it very difficult to use them with any precision; in fact,
they always took exactly the opposite direction to that
in which I wished to throw them, and finally, in an
attempt to 'bolear' a bush, I very narrowly missed
poor Maximo, who was just coming up behind me.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span></p>

<p>As an instance of the skill which may be acquired in
the use of the bolas, I have several times seen Isidoro
throw them at some refractory colt at full gallop, with
such true aim as to make them alight round its hind
legs, and effectually pinion them, without doing the
animal any harm whatever&mdash;a feat which requires immense
confidence and nerve, as the bolas, which are
very heavy, being generally made of stone or lead, have
to be flung with considerable velocity.</p>

<p>The first hunter to return was Garcia. He had
killed a female puma, a great prize, as the meat is excellent,
and especially esteemed during the winter and
spring months, when it is always fat, whereas the
ostriches and guanacos are at that time generally miserably
lean. The brute looked very fierce and dangerous;
the half-opened jaws displayed a row of cruel white
teeth, which gave its face an uncomfortable expression
of rage and spite. The fur was of a yellowish-grey;
and the length of the animal from tip to tail was about
nine feet.</p>

<p>The puma abounds in the pampas, where it preys on
the guanacos and ostriches, lying in ambush for them
in the ravines near where they are in the habit of going
to drink. With one blow of its huge paw, it can kill
a full-sized guanaco; but, notwithstanding its great
strength, the Patagonian puma is of very cowardly instincts,
and if attacked by man, quietly receives its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
death-blow from the balls without any attempt at self-defence.
If taken young they can be easily tamed, and
in that state their manners closely resemble those of
the domestic cat. They are very fond of being taken
notice of, and will purr and stretch themselves under
a caressing hand, like any old tabby. They are extremely
playful and good tempered, attaching themselves
with docility to those with whom they are
familiar.</p>

<p>I was travelling in a steamer once, on board of which
there was a young puma about two months old, which
was being sent to the Zoological Gardens. It was a
graceful, affectionate little animal, and became a great
favourite during the voyage, relieving many a tedious
hour with its playful gambols. Its great delight was to
lie hidden behind a spar, and then suddenly spring out
on some unwary passer-by, to whose leg it would tenaciously
cling, until some other object attracted its attention.
Its inseparable companion was a little Scotch
terrier, with which it would play for hours together,
rather roughly sometimes, it is true, but still without
ever showing any traces of a treacherous or spiteful disposition,
though occasionally its temper must have been
severely tried, as the dog would often seize and carry
away its dinner&mdash;a fighting matter with much better-disposed
animals than pumas.</p>

<p>At dinner that evening we ate a side of the puma
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
Garcia had killed. After I had overcome the repugnance
I at first felt at eating the flesh of a beast of prey, I
found the meat excellent, tasting, as I thought, something
like veal.</p>

<p>We started early the next morning, as we had a
long journey before us, being anxious to reach the Rio
Chico, a tributary of the Santa Cruz River before night-time.</p>

<p>At every step the country across which we were now
travelling grew more sterile, and after about an hour's
ride, we found ourselves in a region of extraordinary
barrenness. Not a blade of grass was to be seen anywhere,
and even the miserable scrub of the plains could
find no nourishment in that bleak tract of salt sand and
broken scoriÃ¦. Traces of volcanic action were everywhere
apparent. Immense boulders of solid rock were
scattered here and there in chaotic confusion, and on
some spots sharp ridges of dark porphyry pierced
through the soil, towering up in fantastic shapes, gloomy
and bare. It seemed like an unfinished portion of the
globe, the very skeleton of a landscape. The outlines
were there, indeed, the framework of the intended structure.
There were bold hills, sheltered valleys, isolated
peaks, deep basins; but over all was silence and desolation,
all was empty and void. The finishing-touch
had been withheld&mdash;the last touch which was to have
softened and modulated those rugged contours, clothing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
their barrenness with verdure, filling the dry basins
with clear water, and bringing life and gladness to
what was now lying in sad and eternal deathliness.</p>

<p>Nature must have made Patagonia last of all her
works, and the horn of Plenty, from which an abundance
of rich gifts had been poured over the rest of the world,
was well-nigh exhausted when that country's turn to
be endowed came round. There still remained a little
grass seed, however, and this was carefully scattered
over the length and breadth of the land. But little
alighted on the hills and plains, for the strong pampa
winds swept it down into the ravines and gulches, under
the shelter of which it took root and flourished, affording
nourishment to the ostrich and guanaco, and preserving
the springs of fresh water from the scorching
rays of the summer's sun.</p>

<p>But one nook had been altogether forgotten during
the distribution of the scanty remains of Nature's gifts,
and accordingly had been doomed to remain desolate
and barren to the end of time, sustaining no vegetable
life, and shunned by all living creatures. And through
that unfortunate region I was now riding, gloomily oppressed
by the spirit of mournful silence and wild
solitude which hung over it, whilst my weary gaze
sought in vain some token of organic existence to relieve
the monotony of lifeless stone and bare sand-hillocks.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span></p>

<p>We rode swiftly, for we all felt the same desire to
escape as quickly as possible to more cheering scenes,
but several hours elapsed before the sight of an occasional
stunted bush or tuft of grey grass showed us we
were nearing a less inhospitable region.</p>

<p>Presently we rode past a long chain of salinas, which
glittered and sparkled whitely in the sun. They were
now partially covered with water, but in summer it
evaporates altogether, leaving a crust of salt on the
surface of the lake of from two to four inches thick.
These salinas are met with all over the pampas, and
from afar often deceive the thirsty hunter, in search of
fresh water, by the similarity they present to a sheet of
the latter, when the sun shines on their white surfaces.
In the depression over which we were now riding, I
counted a succession of more than fifty salinas, which
stretched away as far as I could see towards St. Julian.</p>

<p>I passed one salina which, at a distance, appeared to
be covered with rose-coloured plants. On riding
nearer, I found this delusion to be occasioned by a flock
of flamingoes, which were collected there in great numbers,
to all appearance in solemn conclave, after the
fashion of storks&mdash;a bird which they also resemble in
their general build. They let me come close up to
them, and then, stretching out their long necks, slowly
glided away, alighting again on another salina a little
further off. As they flew up, I observed that the wings
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
were black underneath, in fine contrast to the brilliant
hues of the rest of their plumage, which is of a bright
crimson colour, and very beautiful. One fine, long
feather floated through the air to my feet, and I picked
it up, intending to keep it, along with other similar
trifles, as a relic of my journey. Isidoro, half in joke,
half in earnest, said the occurrence might possibly be
an omen of ill luck and bloodshed&mdash;a prediction which
was subsequently strangely verified, though I laughed
at it at the time, and, of course, thought no more about it.</p>

<p>By this time we had got into the ordinary style of
country again&mdash;short, undulating plains, and ravines
with plenty of grass and underwood. Several ostriches
were caught there, and three nests were pillaged,
yielding in all some forty eggs, which we secured to our
saddles and bodies in various ways.</p>

<p>We now approached the limits of the deep basin or
depression across which we had been travelling all day,
and were faced by an acclivity, similar in height and
steepness to the one we had descended the day previous.
In scaling this wall I had a slight mishap; the prolonged
strain on my saddle caused it to slip back, the girths
loosened, the saddle rolled round, and, hampered by my
capa, I was thrown violently to the ground, breaking in
my fall four eggs which I had previously somewhat
imprudently secured inside my shirt. Maximo came to
my rescue, and helped me to my feet again. My ribs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
felt very sore, and I was severely bruised on the head;
but I was glad to come off so cheaply, for if the horse
had taken fright and run away, entangled as I was in
the saddle-gear, and with my limbs imprisoned in the
folds of the capa, I might have incurred considerable
risk of being dragged over the pampa. We readjusted
the saddle, I remounted, and we started off again,
reaching the summit of the escarpment, without further
mishap.</p>

<p>There we found ourselves on another plain, across
which we journeyed for some time, but finding that it
was too late to reach the Rio Chico that day, we halted
for the night, under shelter of a stout bush of unusual
size.</p>

<p>We had a novel dish that evening, in the shape of a
pair of armadilloes, which some one had caught during
the day, and which Isidoro had artistically roasted with
hot stones.</p>

<p>The species of armadillo which inhabits Patagonia
(<i>Dasypus minutus</i>) is much smaller than any of the
other varieties known in the Brazils, Paraguay, and the
northern provinces of Buenos Ayres. It is found in
great numbers throughout the pampas north of the
Santa Cruz, though south of that river, according to the
testimony of the Indians, it has never been met with.
Why the limit of their range is thus sharply defined, I
am not prepared to say, though the phenomenon may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
possibly be accounted for by the fact that the temperature
on the plains a short distance south of the Santa
Cruz River is surprisingly lower than that of the
northern plains, the change being far greater than the
mere difference in latitude would warrant. The
'mulitos,' as the Spanish call them, are remarkably
good eating, and even in the towns they are considered
great delicacies. In autumn they have a layer of fat
on their backs of from two to three inches, on which
they have to draw in winter, as they pass that season in
a state of torpor, which relieves them of the trouble of
looking for food.</p>

<p>Those that we ate on this occasion were rather thin,
as in that month, September, they commence to leave
their holes; but otherwise the flesh was succulent and
tender, and tasted very much like sucking-pig.</p>

<p>The next morning we set out for the Rio Chico. On
the way we passed several herds of guanacos, some of
which must have numbered more than two hundred
head. They seemed very shy, and disappeared at our
approach with great rapidity, though now and then one
or two, more courageous than the rest, would hang
around us almost within reach of the bolas, frisking
about and executing the most comical antics, as if to
show their contempt for us and their confidence in their
own superior speed.</p>

<p>This self-reliance is not altogether unjustified; the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
guanacos which roam about singly, and which show such
impertinent audacity, are generally tough old males of
immense endurance and speed, and to overtake them
the swiftest greyhound would have to do its utmost.</p>

<p>It is different when a herd is being chased, as then
each animal tries to push into the middle of the flock,
and a general scuffle takes place, which of course considerably
lessens the speed of the mass&mdash;a fact of which
the dogs are perfectly aware, inasmuch as they will
hardly ever take the trouble to chase a single guanaco,
unless specially ordered to do so by their masters,
whereas if a herd comes in sight, it is difficult to keep
them from immediately dashing off after them.</p>

<p>The guanaco has been well described by Captain
Musters as having the head of a camel, the body of a
deer, the wool of a sheep, and the neigh of a horse. The
wool is of a reddish-yellow, intermixed with white in
certain parts of the body. They are scattered in immense
numbers all over Patagonia, and one can never
ride far without hearing the shrill neighing of the
sentinels, which always outflank the main flock to give
warning of the approach of danger. The flesh, when fat,
is excellent, and closely resembles beef; but at the
season I am writing of it is terribly lean and insipid,
and affords very little nourishment, the only palatable
part being the head, which we generally roasted under
the embers, eating it cold.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span></p>

<p>We travelled along over the usual succession of
shingly plain and grassy ravine for some time, without
anything occurring to break the tedium of the ride.
Presently, however, a little off the direction in which
we were going, I noticed a guanaco lying dead, with
fifty or more carranchos hovering expectantly over it;
and as the most commonplace incident becomes of deep
interest to the traveller on the pampas as to the passenger
on board a ship, I rode up to have a glance at
the dead animal. It must have been just then killed,
for I found the body still warm, and the blood was
trickling from a deep gash in its neck. I looked round,
but I could not see the author of the deed anywhere,
though I did not doubt but that he was prowling near,
or else the carranchos would already have settled on the
carcase. We had plenty of other meat, so I merely cut
off its head, tied it to the saddle, and then rode after my
companions.</p>

<p>I had not gone far, however, when my horse suddenly
stopped, snorting wildly and quivering in every limb. I
soon discovered the cause of its terror. Crouching
under a bush, about twenty paces ahead of me, was a
large puma, glaring sullenly at me, with its ugly cat-like
head resting between its outstretched paws. I urged
my horse closer towards it, but the frightened animal
would not budge an inch, and, as I was not within range,
I was obliged to dismount.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span></p>

<p>Drawing my revolver, I cautiously approached the
puma, till I was within easy distance. I then hesitated,
not knowing exactly whether to fire or not. I had
heard a great deal of the cowardice of these animals,
how you may go close up to them, and strike them dead
with the bolas, without their offering any resistance;
but still, this particular puma, I reflected, might happen
to be an exception to the general rule, and turn out to
be an unpleasantly brave animal, which might possibly
resent being fired at, especially if not dealt a wound
instantaneously fatal.</p>

<p>However, I finally plucked up my courage, took steady
aim at the head of the motionless beast, and fired. It
did not stir; I had missed. I went nearer, and fired
again; same result. I began to get excited, and went
still nearer to the unaggressive puma, which was now
hardly ten paces distant, its eyes gleaming at me with a
fixed and stolid stare. I fired once more, and this time
I thought the head twitched. At that moment Isidoro,
who had heard my shots, came up to see what was the
matter, and with him, of course, came his dogs. They
no sooner saw the puma than they flew at it, and
dragged it from under the bush. The reason it had
remained so immovable was immediately explained; the
brute was stone dead. On examining it, I found that
two of my bullets had lodged in its skull, and another
had penetrated its chest, my first shot having probably
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
caused instantaneous death. With the help of Isidoro,
I took off the skin, which was a very fine one; and
leaving the carcase to the carranchos, we galloped off
after the rest of the party.</p>

<p>We reached the Rio Chico at about twelve o'clock.
The exact site of its source is not known, but according
to Indian testimony it comes from an insignificant
stream at a very short distance from the spot we were
now at. Like all rivers in Patagonia, it flows
down a broad valley, which seems to have been in
former times the bed of a much broader river than that
which at present flows through it. Thus the valley of
the Rio Chico is about three miles broad, whilst the
river, at the time I am speaking of, rather swollen by
recent rains, was only some two hundred yards in
width. The valley of the Rio Gallegos is much broader
even than that of the Rio Chico, while one can almost
jump over the river itself in summer.</p>

<p>On account of the fine pasturage they afford for
horses, these valleys are the usual camping-places of
the Indians, and we were therefore not surprised to see
several of their tents pitched on the other side of the
river. I was extremely glad of the opportunity thus
afforded me of making the acquaintance of these wandering
tribes, for whom, having read Captain Musters' 'At
Home with the Patagonians,' I had always felt a peculiar
interest. Captain Musters adopted the only plan by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
which it is possible to obtain a thorough insight into
the peculiarities of the morality and customs of such
people, and to discover the principles which guide their
dealings amongst each other and towards strangers. For
the nonce he forgot that he had ever belonged to
civilisation, and became to all intents and purposes a
Patagonian Indian, living amongst them as one of them,
sharing their pleasures and hardships, and doing his
duty in the hunting-field or in the ball-room with as
much zest and earnestness as if he intended passing his
whole existence among them, and finally becoming a
candidate for some vacant caciqueship.</p>

<p>By these means he became intimately acquainted
with their habits and ways, their domestic life, their
virtues and failings, their loves and their hatreds; and
was thus enabled thoroughly to understand them, and
appreciate many interesting traits in their character
which would have escaped a less attentive and less conscientious
observer.</p>

<p>When we reached the ford, some doubts were expressed
as to whether it was practicable, the river being
swollen far beyond its ordinary level. Garcia rode
cautiously over first, therefore; and on his arriving
safely on the opposite side, none the worse for a little
splashing, the rest of us followed, driving the horses in
before us. The dogs remained behind, setting up a most
dismal yell as they watched us making our way through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
the water; but finding no one offered to carry them
over, they at last took heart and swam after us.</p>

<p>Leaving our horses to graze with those of the Indians,
which were scattered about in knots all over the valley,
we set off at a gallop towards the encampment, on
arriving at which we were soon surrounded by a crowd
of dusky aborigines, who, to judge by their incessant
smiles and laughter, must have been exceedingly glad
to see us.</p>

<p>Our first care was to set up our tent and carefully
stow all our traps and saddle-gear away under it, as
there are some amongst the Indians whose curiosity
prompts them to minutely inspect any article one might
be careless enough to leave within their reach, and
whose absence of mind is so extreme as to frequently
make them forget to restore such articles to their rightful
owners.</p>

<p>I was then at liberty to examine the chattering
groups which had gathered round us, watching all our
doings with the greatest interest, and probably criticising
my civilised appearance with a freedom which, had I
understood their language, I might perhaps have thought
the reverse of complimentary.

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<p>The plains of Patagonia, barren as they are, afford sustenance
to a marvellous profusion of animal life, and
swarm with countless numbers of ostriches, guanacos,
armadilloes, pumas, foxes, and skunks. But they are
but sparsely peopled by the human race. It may be
estimated that the native population of that vast territory
which lies between the Rio Negro and the Straits
of Magellan barely numbers three thousand souls, and
if the mortality among them continues on the same
scale as hitherto, it is to be feared that in a comparatively
short period they will have disappeared altogether
from off the face of the earth, and survive only in
memory as a sad illustration of the remorseless law of
the non-survival of the unfitted.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span></p>

<p>But at no period of its existence as a habitable
country can Patagonia have been well populated; no
people would voluntarily choose it for a permanent
abode, as long as they could range unmolested in the
more hospitable regions of the north, and such tribes as
have from time to time elected to brave its inclement
climate have in so doing doubtless only yielded to dire
necessity, finding the elements, less formidable to encounter
than the unceasing hostilities of more powerful
tribes. Thus the Tehuelches, as the Indians who at
present inhabit the southern plains are called, have in
all probability gradually been driven to this extreme
corner of their continent by the more warlike but intellectually
inferior races of the north, such as the Araucanians,
the Pampas, and others, who in their turn, as
civilisation advances, may perhaps be forced to quit
their present rich pasture-grounds and moderate climate,
and fly to the bare plains of Santa Cruz and St. Julian,
eventually to encounter the same fate of extermination
as that which now hangs over the doomed Tehuelche
race.</p>

<p>The Tehuelches are divided into two tribes, the
Northern and the Southern. The Northerners are the
least numerous, but, on the other hand, they have the
advantage of being less 'civilised' than their Southern
kindred, who, being frequently in contact with the
settlers of Sandy Point, have assimilated not a few of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
the pleasant vices of '<i>los Christianos</i>,' as all white men
are called by them. The Northerners generally pass
the winter at Santa Cruz, and move as summer comes
on towards the Cordilleras. The Southerners range
over the country between Coy Inlet and the straits, and
now and then pay a visit to the settlement at Sandy
Point. In customs and language there is no difference
between these two tribes, and in speaking of the
Tehuelches, I must be understood to be referring indiscriminately
to the Northerners and Southerners.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding that the exaggerated accounts of
early travellers as to the stature of the Patagonians
have frequently been contradicted and disproved, a
great many people seem still to be firmly impressed
with the idea that the race of giants is not yet extinct,
and that it has for its abode that favoured portion of
South America which the Spaniards christened Patagonia.
The truth is that, as regards height, all that can
be said of the Tehuelches is that they are on the average
a tall race, varying in stature from say five feet ten
inches to six feet. Their muscular development and
consequent strength, however, are decidedly abnormal,
and in that sense, at all events, they cannot be denied
to possess one of the most important attributes of
giants.</p>

<p>I once witnessed a remarkable feat of strength performed
by a Northern Tehuelche of the name of Koloby.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
He was leading a horse towards the camp by a lasso,
when the animal for some reason or other suddenly
stopped short, and obstinately refused to stir from the
spot. After a few coaxing, but ineffectual tugs at the
lasso, Koloby gave a short grunt of impatience, and
then, taking the lasso over his shoulder, bent forward,
seemingly without effort, and dragged the horse by main
force for about twenty yards, notwithstanding its determined
attempts at resistance.</p>

<p>The Tehuelches are on the whole rather good-looking
than otherwise, and the usual expression on their faces
is bright and friendly. Their foreheads are rather low,
but not receding, their noses aquiline, their mouths large
and coarse, but their teeth are extremely regular and
dazzlingly white. Their hair, which is long and black,
is kept from falling over their faces by a fillet tied round
the head. They have little hair on the face or body,
and even that they eradicate as much as possible, including
the eyebrows, an operation which must cause no
little pain. Why they do this I don't know, except it
may be that they consider it improves their appearance,
in which case it seems that in its application to the 'poor
Indian,' the saying '<i>Il faut souffrir pour Ãªtre beau</i>'
loses none of its truth or point. In addition to this embellishment,
some tattoo their arms or chest, but it does
not seem to be the general custom.</p>

<p>Their eyes are small and deeply set; the prominence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
of the cheekbones gives great breadth to their faces.
The colour of their skin seems to vary according to the
individual, or rather according to the individual's cleanliness;
but as far as I could ascertain, it is of a reddish-brown,
running in some cases more into a yellowish
tinge. Their general carriage is extremely graceful and
dignified, and their manners towards strangers and one
another are polite and deferential, without a trace of
servility; in fact, they have a certain well-bred air of
restraint, which is quite impressive, and one never feels
inclined to treat them with that familiarity which is bred
of contempt, or that convenient assumption of superiority
which the white man is so apt to display towards
'niggers.'</p>

<p>I do not wish to incur the charge of attempting to
revive the exploded legend of the 'noble savage' in
favour of the Tehuelche race, but I must say that in
general intelligence, gentleness of temper, chastity of
conduct, and conscientious behaviour in their social and
domestic relations, they are immeasurably superior not
only to the other South American indigenous tribes, but
also, all their disadvantages being taken into consideration,
to the general run of civilised white men. Their
natural talents are displayed in a marked manner by the
rapidity with which they pick up a new language, and
the ease with which they grasp the totally new ideas
which the acquiring of a complex foreign tongue must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
necessarily entail on a race whose original range of
thought is of a most limited nature. Amongst the
Southern Tehuelches I met several who spoke Spanish
with ready ease, notwithstanding that they seldom had
opportunities of practising it. There was one Indian,
who called himself Captain Johnson, who surprised me
very much when I first met him by asking me, with a
round British oath, for 'a plug of tobacco.' Further
conversation brought out that many years before he had
lived for a few weeks on board an English schooner,
and hence his knowledge of the language, which he
spoke extremely well, considering that he had of course
never had occasion to keep it up since. Guillaume
told me several instances of the ease with which the
Indians picked up and retained French phrases, which
at their request he had repeated to them. To their many
other praiseworthy characteristics I shall presently revert.</p>

<p>The dress of the men consists of a chiripÃ , fastened at
the waist by a belt, which is frequently richly embossed
with silver. The capa, or mantle of guanaco furs, already
described, completes their attire. When on horseback
their feet are encased in botas de potro; but for reasons
of economy they do not wear them at ordinary times.
The women wear a long calico robe beneath the capa,
which is fastened at the throat with a silver brooch, or a
simple wooden skewer, according to the circumstances
of the individual. Potro boots are a luxury reserved for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
the men. The children, on whom most of the silver
ornaments of the family are lavished, wear a capa like
their elders, and on attaining the age of four or five are
invested with the dignity of a chiripÃ .</p>

<p>When the women grow old they become repulsively
ugly, but the young girls are by no means ill-favoured,
and the looks of even the plainest among them are invariably
redeemed by the bright, smiling expression habitual
to them. Their hair is worn in plaits, artificially
lengthened by means of horsehair; their complexion,
when free from paint, is of a ruddy healthy colour, and
their eyes, which are shaded with long black lashes, are
soft and clear.</p>

<p>Without going so far as to assert that the <i>affaires de
c&oelig;ur</i> of the Tehuelche maidens are always strictly
platonic, I must say that, according to my own observations,
and the confirming statements of others, the
relations between the sexes are uniformly characterised
by a strong sense of decency and unimpeachable propriety.
Polygamy is admitted on principle; but no
man may marry more wives than he can afford to maintain,
and there is, therefore, seldom more than one
mistress to each household. Marriages <i>de convenance</i>
are very rare; but, as a matter of form, the bride is
purchased from her parents for a certain number of
mares, or whatever objects her lover can afford to give.
But as the dowry of the girl generally quite compensates
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
for the expense her lover has incurred in obtaining
her, the transaction must be considered rather as an
exchange of presents than as a mere unsentimental
bargain. Out of mere curiosity to learn the technical
details of Tehuelche marriage-settlements, I once entered
into negotiations with a rich old squaw, for the
purpose of contracting matrimony with her daughter
who was a charming girl of about fifteen. The price
we finally agreed upon was eight mares; a bag of biscuits,
and some sugar, which I was to procure from
Sandy Point. The dowry of the daughter consisted in
four new guanaco mantles. I held out for five, and on
my remaining inflexible on this point, the negotiations
fell through.</p>

<p>Husband and wife seem always to get on very well
together; indeed, one of the pleasantest traits in the
Tehuelche character is the affection with which relations
regard one another. The love of the parents towards
their offspring is almost morbid in its intensity.
Their grief at the decease of an only child frequently
manifests itself in the most exaggerated manner. It is
not unusual in such cases for the parents to burn all
their belongings, kill all their horses, and reduce themselves
to a state of utter poverty&mdash;a touching proof of
the sincerity and depth of their sorrow, if not of the
soundness of their views on practical economy.</p>

<p>Their indulgence towards their children is unlimited.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
I have never seen a child chidden or remonstrated with,
whatever mischievous pranks it may have been up to,
and in all their internal arrangements the interest of
the baby portion of the community seems to be the first
which is consulted. For my part, I must say I by no
means shared in the feelings of the elders with regard
to their youthful progeny; on the contrary, I always
considered the latter as a most unmitigated nuisance.
They are dirty and vicious, as mischievous as monkeys,
and as thievish as magpies. The 'Artful Dodger' would
have had to look to his laurels if he had had to enter
into competition with a young Tehuelche. Their deftness
of hand, as I have many a time experienced to my
cost, is remarkable. On one occasion, I rode over to
their camp from Santa Cruz, on an English saddle, and
as I knew that the stirrup-leathers, which are in great
demand for belts on account of the buckles, would prove
too great a temptation, I took care not to leave the
saddle at all during my short stay, thinking by that
means to obviate any danger of losing my cherished
stirrup-leathers. But even this precaution proved insufficient.
In an unguarded moment, whilst bending
over my horse's neck in conversation with an Indian
who was sitting on the ground below me, by way of
resting myself a little, I incautiously slipped one foot
out of its stirrup, and lay at my full length along the
horse's back. I was hardly two minutes in that position,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
but I was two minutes too long. On resuming my seat
in the saddle, my foot sought in vain for the stirrup,
and on looking down I discovered, to my wrath, that
during my momentary inattention the stirrup-leather
had quietly been slipped off and made away with. Of
course, I immediately dismounted in a great rage, and
set to to find the thief. After a fruitless search, I returned
to my horse, and, lo and behold, in the meanwhile,
the other stirrup-leather had disappeared! In my
precipitate haste, I had quite forgotten that whilst I
was looking for its fellow, it might be abstracted as
well; and the upshot of the whole affair was that, with
many a strong interjectional reference to my own
stupidity, I had to ride stirrupless back to Santa Cruz,
some fifteen miles away. I had no doubt at the time,
and indeed I subsequently discovered, that two youngsters
had been the perpetrators of the neat theft.</p>

<p>One would think that under such training, as they
grew older, their faults would increase; but just the
contrary is the case, and by the time they attain their
fifteenth or sixteenth year they abandon their brattish
ways, and become 'respectable,' steady-going members
of their community.</p>

<p>The division of labour in a Tehuelche <i>mÃ©nage</i> is perhaps
not strictly equitable, for by far the greater part of
the day's work falls on the fair sex. The men go hunting
when the larder is low, and occasionally, in a dawdling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
kind of way, they mend their riding-gear, or make
bolas, lassoes, etc.; but they have an insurmountable
aversion to anything that looks like hard work. The
squaws, on the other hand, are busy from morning till
night. They are the hewers of wood and the drawers of
water, and all the onus of housekeeping, breaking up
the camp, arranging the tents&mdash;including, of course, the
care of the children, the <i>cuisine</i>, and so forth&mdash;is delegated
to them. When not otherwise employed, they
sew guanaco capas or weave fillets, and their fingers, at
all kinds of work, are as nimble as their tongues, with
which latter they keep up an incessant chatter, which,
however, does not prevent them from getting through an
astonishing amount of work.</p>

<p>Of their origin little is to be said. They recognise a
good spirit and a bad spirit (Gualichu); but there is
little sincerity or earnestness either in their reverence
for the one, or in their fear of the other. According to
the caprice of the moment, either of these spirits is most
cavalierly treated by them, and the respect they occasionally
profess towards them gives way as often as not
to indifference, contempt, or anger. The fact is, that
with the Tehuelches the prime rule in life is to take
everything as easily as possible, to the exclusion of all
other considerations; and, acting on the doctrine of the
Epicureans, that it is a man's duty to endeavour to
increase to the utmost his pleasures and diminish to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
utmost his pains, they are careful not to admit any
theories which might possibly disturb their peace of
mind. Thus they are strongly averse to the idea of
vesting in a supernatural agent the power of interfering
in their affairs to any great extent, arguing that such
power having once been vested, it might on a contingency
be used detrimentally to their own comfort and interests.
On the other hand, it could not escape them that very
often a most convenient excuse for their peccadilloes
was to be found in attributing them to the evil influence
of some bad spirit. To avoid the dilemma occasioned
by the above conflicting considerations, they accordingly
created the Gualichu, a most accommodating devil, who
allows himself to be ignored or brought forward, as may
best suit the momentary purpose of his clients. The
good spirit, for obvious reasons, one hears very little
about; the Tehuelche is quite willing to take the credit
of his good actions on himself alone.</p>

<p>The office of chief or cacique among them is not
altogether a sinecure; but its authority is extremely
limited, being exercised merely in such slight matters
as the choice of the spot where the tribe is to camp, the
route to be followed, and so forth. The Tehuelches are
very jealous of their personal liberty; and complete individual
equality is the recognised basis of their social
and political system. Paraphrasing Wordsworth, I may
say in prose, 'A rich man is a rich man to them, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
he is nothing more,' In other words, the fact of one of
their number possessing forty or fifty horses more than
his fellows, seems to be accepted by them as a simple
fact, which excites neither respect for the possessor nor
envy of his good fortune. Nor would it for a moment
occur to the owner of the forty or fifty horses to fancy
himself in any way superior to his poorer brethren.
The little credit which wealth, <i>per se</i>, commands, saves
the Indians from a great many of the repugnant vices
of white men, such as avarice, jealousy, servility, etc.,
and keeps up a healthy, independent feeling among
them, which is pleasantly manifested in the politeness
and kindliness of their personal intercourse.</p>

<p>They have a peculiar custom, moreover, which is well
calculated to preserve the existing state of things.
When an Indian dies, however many horses he may
possess, they are all killed, and his other belongings are
scrupulously burned. Thus, no family can acquire such
a preponderance of wealth as would enable it, in time,
to obtain an ascendant influence over and curtail the
liberties of the rest of the tribe. Whatever the defects
of this system may be, from the political economist's
point of view, it seems to be very well adapted to the
desires and circumstances of the Tehuelches; and as an
instance of how socialistic tendencies may be practically
modified to suit certain exceptional conditions of existence,
it is, perhaps, not without some interest.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span></p>

<p>If required to distinguish the Tehuelche by a single
characteristic epithet, I should call him, not the noble,
but the happy savage. Far from being saturnine or
grave, he is as light-hearted as a child, all mirth and
contentment, and wonderfully easily moved to laughter.
Life is, indeed, a very pleasant matter for him. Without
any exertion on his part being necessary, all his
wants are supplied in abundance. He has no onerous
daily drudgery to undergo; he has no enemies to fear;
he is not driven from his hunting-grounds to starvation
and death, like his North American cousins, by the
ever-advancing white man. He is seldom visited by
sickness, and his life is unusually prolonged. That he
has absolutely no troubles I will not affirm, but if he
has any he certainly takes them very lightly.</p>

<p>To conclude these few remarks on the Tehuelche race
in reviewing their characteristics it is impossible not to
award them a high rank in the list of uncivilised nationalities.
To admit that they have many faults, is, after
all, merely saying that they are human; but these
faults are redeemed by many unusual excellences.
They are good-natured, hospitable, and affectionate;
their instincts are gentle; violence and ferocity are
foreign to their nature; and though not invariably veracious
nor strictly honest, if they think you trust them,
they will take care not to deceive you. Their one
great failing is their addiction to rum, to whose fatal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
agency the rapid decrease in their numbers, and the
consequent fast-approaching extinction of their race,
must be ascribed.</p>

<p>But to return to my narrative. Our tent having been
set up, and all our saddle-gear stowed away, I strolled
into the Indian camp, followed by the chattering crowd
which had come out to meet us. My curious glances at
these children of the desert were certainly repaid with
interest; and they subjected my person and belongings
to the closest scrutiny. The texture of my coat was
carefully examined, and appeared to give rise to a
lengthy discussion, which was carried on with more
zeal and earnestness than the merits of the subject
would seem to warrant, and nothing but a good stare of
several minutes' duration at my face seemed to satisfy
even the least curious among them.</p>

<p>The camp was composed of five toldos, or tents, each
tent containing on the average about twenty-five souls.
These toldos are very practically constructed, and, notwithstanding
their formidable size, they are set up or
taken down by the squaws in a surprisingly short space
of time. A covering made of guanaco skins is drawn
over a rough framework of wood, consisting of a double
row of stakes and cross-beams, lashed together with
thongs of guanaco hide. The front of the tent is generally
open, but it can be closed whenever occasion requires.
The interior is divided into partitions, each
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
inmate having his own bunk, where he sleeps and
where his gear and chattels are stowed away when not
in use.</p>

<p>I entered one of these tents, and looked about me.
In the front part there were three or four small fires,
round each of which sat a circle of Indians, who were
warming their toes, and smoking or taking matÃ©. The
squaws were all hard at work, sewing capas, weaving
fillets, or tying up bundles of ostrich feathers. At my
approach they stopped working, and broke into a chorus
of guttural commentaries on my appearance, interspersed
with a great deal of noisy laughter, which they kept
up till I left the tent. Little children and dogs were
sprawling about the place in all directions, apparently
on very good terms with each other&mdash;a dog not unfrequently
gnawing at one end of a piece of meat, off the
other end of which a young Tehuelche hopeful was
making his dinner. In another corner was a group
deeply immersed in the chances and changes of a game
of cards. Some of the Indians are inveterate gamblers,
and play for very high stakes indeed. It is not an
uncommon thing for a 'plunger' to risk all his horses
and his saddle-gear, knife and bolas to boot, on the
chances of a single game.</p>

<p>We visited all the tents, and then went back to enjoy
a pipe by our own fireside. We had not been long
seated when quite a deputation of pretty young squaws
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
arrived, to interview us. They bashfully sat down
at some distance from our fire, and for a time did
nothing but giggle and look shy. At last one of them,
the prettiest (artful daughters of Eve!), after a great deal
of argument and some persuasive pushing, seemed to
consent to become the spokeswoman of the party, and
taking courage, came boldly up to us, and producing a
plate from under her capa, with a very engaging smile
she held it out to me, repeating the word 'Azucar'
several times in a pleading, coaxing tone, which it was
impossible to resist. I gave her some sugar and biscuit,
with which she returned to her companions, seemingly
very much pleased. After having sat for a few minutes
longer, just for politeness' sake, as it were, they got up
and went back to their homes. They must have reported
favourably on the results of their expedition, for they
had not been gone long when another lot arrived, who
also wanted azucar. We had just doled out a small
portion to them, when still another crowd came down
upon us, composed chiefly of elderly squaws, each with
a plate, and such a cheerful desire to see it filled with
sugar, that it became necessary to restrain our generous
instincts, and stow away the sugar bags in the depths
of our tent. Finding us inexorable, the elders soon
took their departure, in great good-humour, and seemingly
as happy as if they had got all they wanted.</p>

<p>We were favoured with a great many visits during
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
dinner, and at one time we were the centre of a circle
of men, women, and children, two rows deep, who were
incessant in their demands for biscuit, sugar, or something,
but so calmly indifferent under the inevitable
refusal with which, in self-defence, we were obliged to
meet all their supplications, that it seemed they really
did not care whether they got anything given to them
or not. Post-prandially I mused whether, after all, they
had not the advantage over me. It is true I had 'the
cakes and ale;' but then, on the other hand, to make
matters even, they had the finely-balanced temperament
which enabled them to bear the want of those luxuries
with the most perfect equanimity.</p>

<p>After dinner, Garcia sat down to play cards with an
Indian. I watched him lose successively his bolas, his
lasso, his knife, and his saddle, and when I went to bed
he was just commencing another game, for which the
stakes were a horse a side. I fully expected to wake
up the next morning and find that he had lost his whole
troop; but he was not so unfortunate, and when they
finally left off playing he was only a pair of bolas to
the bad.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<p>The next morning, having said good-bye to Isidoro, who
was stopping some days with the Indians before coming
down to Santa Cruz to accompany me to Sandy Point,
we started off at a brisk gallop, which in about three
hours brought us to the broad valley down which the
Santa Cruz River rolls its rapid and tortuous course.</p>

<p>The weather was already sensibly colder than at St.
Julian. On our road we encountered several snow and
hail-storms, and were therefore not sorry when we at
last arrived in front of Pavon Island, where there is a
small house, built many years ago by an Argentine, who
lived there for the purpose of trading with the Indians&mdash;a
business still carried on by its present inmate, Don
Pedro Dufour.</p>

<p>On hearing our shouts, the inmates of the island, <i>i.e.</i>,
Don Pedro and his peon, came over to us in a small
boat, in which our effects and persons were safely transported
to the island. The horses and dogs had to swim
over as best they could, and a very hard and cold job
they must have found it, as the current of the river
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
runs with extreme velocity, something over six miles an
hour.</p>

<p>The house into which Don Pedro gave us a hearty
welcome, was built of adobe and stones, and contained
two dwelling-rooms, a kitchen, and a store-room. There
was another smaller house on the island, used as a
store-room for the sugar, biscuit, aguadiente, etc., which
Don Pedro barters with the Indians for guanaco capas
and ostrich feathers.</p>

<p>In the long grass behind the house a troop of horses
was grazing, together with four or five fine sheep, with
which, judging by their splendid condition, the pasturage
of Patagonia evidently agreed. A pig was grunting and
clamouring greedily for food in a pen hard by; ducks,
pigeons, and other poultry were pecking about the yard;
a thrush was singing in a cage hung up outside the
house, and altogether there was quite a homely, civilised
look about the place which I should not have expected
to find, considering that it is the only fixed human
habitation in that immense desert, which extends for a
distance of some seven hundred miles, from Chubut to
Sandy Point&mdash;a desert whose area is twice that of Great
Britain, and whose only inhabitants are a few ostrich-hunters
and Indians.</p>

<p>Pending Isidoro's arrival, I made several excursions
in the neighbourhood of the island, amongst others,
one to the port of Santa Cruz, where in the hollow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
of a sheltered ravine stands the settlement of M.
Rouquand. The houses, of which there are several,
built of timber brought from Buenos Ayres for the
purpose, I found to be little the worse for wear or
weather.</p>

<p>The caÃ±on where these houses stand is still called
'Les Misioneros,' for it was there that some missionaries
resided in 1863, who laboured for a time at the
attempted conversion of the Tehuelches to Christianity,
without, however, meeting with the success their endeavours
deserved.</p>

<p>It is a pity that M. Rouquand's courageous attempt
at colonising that desert place and founding an industry,
whose success would have been an incentive to further
enterprise, should have been thwarted by Chili's having
taken umbrage at his occupying a miserable piece of
ground, of no possible value to anybody, without having
previously gone through the formality of asking their
ratification of the concession granted him by the Argentine
Government.</p>

<p>The port of Santa Cruz is formed by the confluence
of the river of that name and its tributary, the Rio
Chico, which at this point expands into a broad bay,
capable of affording shelter to a number of ships, and of
easy access from the ocean, there being about fifty feet
of water over the bar at high tide.</p>

<p>The river Santa Cruz varies in breadth from four
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
hundred yards to nearly a mile, and runs along a winding
valley, which extends in a direct line to the westward.
In 1834 an expedition under Admiral Fitzroy,
composed of three light boats, manned by eighteen
sailors, started up the river, with the object of ascertaining
its source; but having ascended a distance of
140 miles from the sea, and 240 by the course of the
river, want of provisions obliged him to turn back,
especially as, finding no diminution in the volume of its
waters, he inferred that its upper course must be along
the base of the Andes, from north to south, and that
its source must probably be near that of the Rio Negro,
in lat. 45Â° S.</p>

<p>In this conjecture he was at error, for in 1877 Dr.
F. Moreno successfully determined the source of the
Santa Cruz as being taken from a lake situated in lat.
50Â° 14&prime; S., and long. 71Â° 59&prime; W., some miles from Lake
Viedma, with which, however, it has no visible communication.
This fine sheet of water measures thirty
miles from east to west, and ten miles at its greatest
breadth; its depth Dr. Moreno was unable to ascertain&mdash;with
a line of 120 feet he could find no bottom at a
short distance from the shore.</p>

<p>According to the same authority the greatest depth
of the river is seventy feet, but the rapidity of the
current, in some places as much as fifteen miles an hour,
must have prevented reliable soundings being taken.</p>

<p>Near Lake Viedma is a volcano, the Chalten, which,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
according to the Indians, still throws out quantities of
ashes. At the time Dr. Moreno was there, a column of
smoke was issuing from its crater.</p>

<p>The country around Santa Cruz River differs in no
way from that I had already traversed, one of the
peculiarities of Patagonian landscape being its complete
sameness. The plains, which occupy the greater portion
of the country, extend along the Atlantic Ocean.
The line separating them from the fertile mountain
regions is extremely sharply defined. Beginning at
Cape Negro, Magellan Straits, lat. 53Â° S. and long.
75Â° 50&prime; W., it runs thence west-north-west to the north-eastern
extremity of Otway Water, following the channels
of Fitzroy Passage, and the northern shores of
Skyring Water to long. 72Â° W., and then extends along
the eastern shores of Obstruction Sound and Kirke
Water, running then due northward towards Lake
Viedma. These plains rise almost uniformly, 300 feet
high, one above another, like terraces, and are traversed
occasionally by ravines and flat-bottomed depressions,
which latter frequently contain salt lakes. The formation
of the country is tertiary, resting on porphyry and
quartz, ridges of which often protrude through the surface.
Near long. 70Â° W. the plains are capped with a
layer of lava, about a hundred miles in width.</p>

<p>Darwin accounts for the regularity with which the
plains rise one over the other by the supposition that
the land has been raised in a mass from under the sea,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
the upheaving movement having been interrupted by at
least eight long periods of rest, during which the sea ate
deeply back into the land, forming at successive levels
the long lines of escarpments which separate the different
plains.</p>

<p>In that strange country the vegetable kingdom is as
little varied as the aspect of the landscape: from Chubut
to Sandy Point, from the sea-coast to the Cordilleras,
one meets the same few species of miserable stunted
bushes and coarse grasses.</p>

<p>The following is a cut showing the formation of the
country at Port St. Julian:*</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span></p>

<p>Of bushes, the most frequent are the jume (<i>Salicemia</i>)
and the calafatÃ© (<i>Berberis axifolia</i>). The former
plant is remarkably rich in soda, as will be seen by the
following analysis of its ash:</p>

<p>Though they are so little favoured by nature, still I
must confess that in the sober-hued Patagonian landscapes,
with their grave breadth and stern severity of
outline, and in the grand monotony of solemn silence
and solitude pervading their barren plains, there is
something which has left a far deeper impression on my
mind than has the brightest and most varied tropical
scenery. Standing in the midst of one of those seemingly
endless plains, one experiences an indefinable feeling
of awe, akin to that which the contemplation of the
ocean produces, only, perhaps, more impressively grand;
for the ocean is ever noisy and restless, the pampa
eternally silent and still.</p>

<p>During my stay at Santa Cruz, nothing of importance
occurred, if I may except a ball given by the Indians at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
Rio Chico, in honour of somebody's marriage or funeral:
I forget which. An Indian who came to the island to
get the rum, which is a <i>sine quÃ¢ non</i> at all their entertainments,
invited us to assist at the ball&mdash;an offer
which we readily accepted.</p>

<p>On arriving at the camp, a very lively scene presented
itself to our eyes. As is customary on such occasions,
several mares had been killed, and roasting and boiling
was going on at numerous fires. Everyone was feasting
in the greatest good-humour, which on our approach
was further heightened, scouts having already brought
the news that we were coming with the aguadiente.</p>

<p>The advent of the latter was greeted with loud acclamations;
some of the older men gathered round the
cask, which was speedily tapped, and then with great
unction and solemnity they proceeded to taste the
liquor, in order to see whether it had been overwatered.
Several decided grunts of satisfaction, however, showed
that these aged fathers approved of its strength; whereupon
a general and doubtless equitable distribution of
the spirit took place, and before long the whole camp&mdash;men,
women, and children&mdash;had ample opportunities for
judging of its merits for themselves.</p>

<p>Presently a dance was organised. The men who took
part in it were all specially painted for the occasion, and
wore long feathers on their heads. The dance itself
was a monotonous jig, executed to the excruciating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
music of various drums or tom-toms. The women,
strange to say, do not dance; at least, they did not as
long as they were sober.</p>

<p>As the evening wore on, after vast quantities of meat
had been consumed and innumerable dances had been
performed, special attention began to be paid to the
aguadiente, and the fun consequently soon began to get
very fast and very furious.</p>

<p>Long before midnight everyone was more or less
drunk, and the ball which had commenced with becoming
order and solemnity had now degenerated into
a wild orgie. The flames from the different fires,
strangely blended with the pale moonlight, cast a lurid
glare on the dusky bodies and painted faces of the
revellers, who, mad with excitement and drink, were
dancing, singing, and whooping in deafening concert.
A more gruesome scene it was hard to imagine. It
seemed as if the imps of darkness were celebrating
their unearthly rites in this desert spot, and I half
expected, at any moment, to see the whole crew vanish,
with a flash and a bang, into the bowels of the earth,
leaving the orthodox smell of sulphur behind them.</p>

<p>Nothing of the sort occurred, however, though I
presently received a shock almost as startling as any
supernatural event could have been. An old squaw,
who was painfully of this world and the vanities thereof,
and who had previously been addressing me for some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
time in the most eloquent of gutturals, finding that
nothing could melt my icy demeanour, as a last resource
suddenly threw her arms round my unsuspecting neck
and hugged me in a greasy embrace.</p>

<p>With great difficulty I managed to free myself,
whereupon I ran away towards some other part of the
camp, to escape further annoyance. Had this old
beldame been acquainted with woman's privileges on
such occasions, she would have known that, under the
circumstances, the correct thing to have done was to
have fainted or become hysterical. But nothing could
have been further from the thoughts of this unenlightened
savage&mdash;the impulse of her untrained mind
being to run after me as hard as her legs could carry
her. And the rest of the Indians, with one of those
sudden whims drunken people are liable to, took it into
their heads to join in the chase, and I soon had the
whole crowd shrieking and howling at my heels. What
their intentions were I don't know, nor did I feel
inclined to discover; fortunately, before they came up
to me I reached my horse, which I had left ready
saddled, and galloping swiftly away, I soon left them
behind me.</p>

<p>I was presently joined by Garcia and the others, who
had taken the same opportunity to escape in order to
avoid the rows with which these balls frequently wind
up. They are not often attended by actual bloodshed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
however, as the squaws, with naÃ¯ve foresight, generally
hide all weapons before the ceremonies commence. We
reached Santa Cruz shortly after daybreak, and so ended
my first experience of a Tehuelche merry-making.</p>

<p>I called at the camp the next day to pay my <i>visite de
digestion</i>, and made a point of going to the tent where
the old squaw, who was so near becoming <i>teterrima
causa belli</i>, abode. She had a bad headache, and
looked very demure and penitent. I rallied her with
smiles, and attempted, by my assiduous attentions, to
make up for my discourteous behaviour of the previous
evening. But she took no notice of me, and received
all my overtures with the utmost indifference. It was
a case of&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<p>Shortly after, on the 2nd of October, Isidoro came over
to Pavon Island, with his horses and some 250 lb. of
ostrich feathers sewn up in hides, which he was going
to take down to Sandy Point to barter, and I accordingly
made the necessary arrangements for accompanying
him.</p>

<p>Never was a more unlucky trip commenced under
more unfavourable auspices.</p>

<p>I was extremely unwell, and my indisposition increased
with every hour. Isidoro, in crossing over to
the island, had lost his whip in the river, and he seemed
to consider this a sure omen of misfortune. The mishap
threw quite a gloom over his mind, and he almost
decided on giving up the journey altogether. With
great difficulty I persuaded him to relinquish this
intention, though I little thought as I did so that I was
indirectly drawing him to his ruin.</p>

<p>The weather, too, was unpropitious. Twice heavy
showers of rain made us turn back when on the point
of starting. We had already unsaddled our horses and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
put off our departure till the next day; but towards
midday the sun again shone out, and that finally
decided us to make a definite start.</p>

<p>As we calculated that our journey to Sandy Point
would last about eight days, we took but few provisions;
and in order to spare the pack-horse as much as possible,
we left our tent behind, trusting to the weather
not to be too severe upon us. The cavalcade consisted
of Isidoro, Guillaume, and myself, twenty-eight horses,
and five dogs.</p>

<p>Having said good-bye to Don Pedro, Garcia, and
Maximo, who were remaining at Santa Cruz, we
mounted our horses, forded the river, and got under
route.</p>

<p>We had not gone far when the weather again changed
for the worse. A drizzling sleet&mdash;half rain, half snow&mdash;began
to fall, and a thick mist settled down on the
hills, giving an indescribably mournful appearance to
the at all times gloomy country.</p>

<p>We rode along in the lowest of spirits and in the
midst of a cheerless silence, broken only by the patter
of the rain or the splashing of our horses' hoofs over the
marshy ground. As we went on, my headache grew
more and more violent, and every movement of the
horse made me wince with pain; but not wishing to
turn back now that we were once off, I bore up as well
as I could for several hours, till at last, burning with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
fever and thoroughly exhausted with the efforts I had
made to subdue my sufferings, I fairly began to reel in
my saddle, and, finding it impossible to continue any
longer on horseback, I called out to my companions to
halt.</p>

<p>Although we were just in the middle of a bare plain,
there was fortunately a little grass growing round the
borders of a small sheet of water near where I dismounted,
or otherwise, on account of the horses, we
should have been obliged to continue till we got to the
next ravine, which was still a considerable distance off.</p>

<p>They made a bed for me under a low bush, and I
was glad to be able to lie down. I suffered intensely
all through the night, tossing sleeplessly about, and
longing for dawn to appear.</p>

<p>The morning found me in such a state that, much to
my own and my companions' regret, it was quite impossible
to continue the journey, though, had I foreseen
the consequences of that one day's delay, I would have
gone on, even if I had had to be lashed to the saddle.</p>

<p>It was altogether a very miserable time. It is pleasant
enough to roam over the pampa when you are
strong and well, and can enjoy a good gallop after an
ostrich in that pure, inspiriting air, when the coarsest
food seems delicious, and you can sleep as soundly on
the hardest couch as on the softest feather-bed; but it
is another thing when you are sick and in pain, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
miss the darkened room, the tempting viands, the cooling
drinks, and the thousand devices which make
sickness less trying. When, instead, you have to face
the weary pangs of illness, exposed alternately to the
glaring sunshine and the cold rain showers, stretched
on the bare ground, a hard saddle for your pillow, a
miserable bush your sole shelter against the cutting
wind. Then, like me, you will probably lose a little of
your enthusiasm for the romantic life of the pampa,
and sigh for the comforts of humdrum civilisation.</p>

<p>The next day my anxiety to reach Sandy Point as
early as possible, urged me to declare that I felt well
enough to continue the journey, and enabled me to
support the unintermitting pains the movement of the
horse inflicted on my sore body, which, without the
assistance of so strong a motive, I should hardly have
been able to do.</p>

<p>However, I gradually got better, and by the time we
reached Coy Inlet, which was on the fourth day after
leaving Santa Cruz, I felt all right again. We found
Coy Inlet River rather swollen, but the ford was still
quite passable, from which circumstance we concluded
that that of the river Gallegos would be equally so&mdash;a
matter of congratulation for us, as at that time of the
year the snows melt in the Cordilleras, and the rivers
are frequently impassable for several days together.</p>

<p>We were in high spirits over that evening's supper,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
and already began calculating how many nights we had
yet to pass before we should be able to go to sleep,
heedless of wind or rain, under roof in Sandy Point.
It was the last cheerful evening we were to pass for a
long time to come, though we little dreamt it.</p>

<p>The following morning we started for our next stage,
Rio Gallegos, which is about fifty miles from Coy Inlet.</p>

<p>The pace we travelled at was a kind of amble, half trot,
half canter, though occasionally, when the nature of the
ground we were riding over permitted, we would break
into an easy gallop. The horses of Patagonia are remarkable
for their endurance; seventy or eighty miles
a day over that most trying country, with its rapid
succession of steep escarpments, seems nothing to them,
and if at the end of the day's journey an ostrich starts
up, they will answer to the spur and dash away after
it as fresh and as gamely as if they had just been
saddled.</p>

<p>The guanacos seemed more numerous than ever in
the plains we were now crossing; some herds which
swept past us, I think, must have numbered quite six
or seven hundred head. They gave us far more trouble
than we gave them, for every now and then the dogs,
who with difficulty could keep cool in the presence of
such abundance of game, would make a dash at some
peculiarly tempting quarry, only to be brought back
to their masters' heels, after much whistling and shouting,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
thereby causing considerable delay in our onward
progress.</p>

<p>On this day I was particularly struck with the change
in the temperature, which had been gradually growing
colder since we left Santa Cruz, and which was now
already unpleasantly raw and severe. Over the plain,
too, there was a keen wind blowing, which seemed to go
right through one, and we were glad when we at last
reached a long ravine called the Ravine of the Squaws,
which leads down from the plains into Gallegos valley.
It bears this name because, when coming from Coy
Inlet, the Indian women always enter the valley by
that route. As they then form in single file, the hoofs
of so many horses following in each other's wake have
gradually worn several deep but narrow trails into the
soil. The men ride down anywhere, without reference
to the movements of the squaws, who always approach
their camps from exactly the same points. The Indians
change their camps with tolerable regularity according
to the time of the year. They generally pass the winter
together in Coy Inlet or Gallegos valley, and in spring,
after the young guanaco hunting is over, they break up
and disperse; some going to the Cordilleras, others to
Santa Cruz, and others again to Sandy Point, though the
latter settlement is never honoured with their presence
long, as there is not sufficient pasturage for the horses
in that region, and the dogs, too, have to subsist on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
very short rations, as ostriches are rather scarce in the
vicinity of Sandy Point, and guanacos do not range so
far south.</p>

<p>Presently a turn of the ravine brought us in full view
of the valley, though the river itself was as yet invisible.
A few minutes would now settle all doubts as to the
state of the ford. We broke into a gallop, craning our
necks anxiously to get a glimpse of the water, in rather
dubious suspense. It was of material importance for
me to take the steamer of the 15th of that month, and
if the river was unfordable I knew we might have to
wait for at least eight days before the waters would
subside, and that delay would cause me to lose my
steamer.</p>

<p>Suddenly Isidoro, who was some way ahead, drew in
his reins and stopped short, turning round with a look
of blank dismay on his brown face, which told but too
plainly that our worst fears were realised. With drooping
reins we rode slowly on till we got to the river, now
no longer the shallow stream which in summer one can
wade over knee-deep, but a broad torrent, which
eddied, swirled, and foamed, as it dashed rapidly over
its stormy bed through banks which were already growing
too narrow for its swollen waters. In the middle
we could still see a single tuft of long grass, which was
bending with the current, and this, Isidoro told me,
grew on a little island, which when the river is fordable,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
is several feet above the water's level. Twenty-four
hours ago it had doubtless been high and dry. We had
arrived just a day too late&mdash;the day lost on account of
my illness!</p>

<p>We stood for some time in silence, staring blankly
at the obstacle which had suddenly sprung up to bar
our progress, with a feeling of utter disgust and helplessness;
and then, the first shock of the disappointment
over, we began to discuss the chances in favour of a
speedy fall of the water. Isidoro was of opinion, from
previous acquaintance with the river at that season,
that in eight days at the most, it would have sunk to
its ordinary level, two or three consecutive days of frost
being quite sufficient to arrest the thawing of the snows
on the Cordilleras, and to cause the river to fall as
rapidly as it had risen.</p>

<p>But even eight days seemed a long time to look
forward to; eight days to be passed in tiresome inaction
and constant exposure to the weather, and we now
bitterly regretted not having brought the tent with us.
Our provisions, too, had only been calculated for a ten-days'
trip, and were already almost exhausted. Though,
of course, we need never want for meat, still lean meat,
without salt or any farinaceous adjunct, is not the kind
of diet to keep up one's strength in cold weather, and
under all sorts of exertions and hardships. All these
disagreeables, however, seemed slight ones, compared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
with the misfortune of having lost the steamer of the
15th, by which, for pressing reasons, I ought to have
immediately proceeded to Buenos Ayres. There was
now no other chance of leaving Sandy Point till the
30th. Isidoro, too, had some reason to be concerned at
the delay, for if he did not reach the settlement soon,
he knew the price of feathers would have fallen considerably,
and he would make but a bad bargain.
Altogether, it was with heavy hearts that we slowly
turned from the river, in search of some suitable spot
for camping at. In that respect we were unfortunate
also, not being able to find a sheltering bush anywhere.
Gallegos is the favourite camping-place of the Indians
during several months of the year, and consequently
any bushes which may formerly have existed in the
immediate neighbourhood of the valley, had long been
broken up by the squaws for firewood. Finally, we had
to camp on the open, about three miles from the river,
sheltered slightly on one side by the tall escarpment
which bounds one side of the valley, but exposed on all
others to whatever wind might choose to blow, and if
it should happen to rain we had of course no means of
keeping anything dry.</p>

<p>Another inconvenience of not having some bush to
camp under was that the fire was completely at the
mercy of the wind, and flared away without emitting
any warmth, blinding those who sat round it with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
smoke, and making it very difficult to cook anything
properly. With the packages containing Isidoro's
feathers we managed to rig up a kind of makeshift to
obviate this difficulty, and then we all three set about
looking for firewood, to collect which we had to wander
about for a long time, as the whole country round
seemed to have been swept bare of that necessary by the
Indians.</p>

<p>We were not very cheerful over our dinner that
evening, as may be imagined. The fire burned badly,
the air was cold and damp, and soon after our meal we
rolled ourselves in our furs, and prepared to pass the
first of the many nights we were fated to sleep through
on the banks of the river Gallegos.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<p>My first thought on waking the next morning was, of
course, the river. During the night, in a moment of
wakefulness, a steady rumbling noise, the rush of distant
water, had struck on my listening ear, and I was
accordingly prepared to find a further rise in the river
at daylight. But the sight which now met my gaze
took me by surprise notwithstanding. The whole of
the lower-lying portion of the valley, as far as the eye
could reach, was one sheet of water, and the flood was
almost visibly rising towards those parts which yet
remained dry. The river itself was no longer distinguishable,
being confounded with the general mass of
water, but we could plainly hear the dull roar of its
mighty current, which was still sweeping down with
unabated force, bearing on its curling waters huge trunks
of trees, which, perhaps, but the day before had been
torn from the distant Cordilleras.</p>

<p>On account of the high position of our camp, we
were as yet far from the flood, though if it continued to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
rise as rapidly as hitherto, we might soon have to move
further on.</p>

<p>Isidoro, too, was quite aghast at the dimensions the
inundation was assuming. He had never seen the river
so swollen before, and began seriously to doubt whether,
in a fortnight even, we should be able to cross over, as
there was no knowing how long the rise would continue.
The snowfall of the past winter had been heavier than
any of the oldest Indians could remember, and it might
reasonably be supposed that the spring-floods would
be proportionately unusual in volume and duration.</p>

<p>We passed all that day in gloomy forebodings, watching
the progress of the water. At night-time it was
still steadily rising. The following morning we found
the flood had risen to within fifteen feet of our camp;
but we had the satisfaction of finding that it was already
abating, for during the night it had been several feet
higher, as evinced by the marks left on the grass. Indeed,
all day it kept on falling, and so rapidly that we
commenced to speculate on whether the river might not
eventually subside as quickly as it had risen, and allow
us to cross over, after all, within the eight days we had
from the first considered as the probable duration of our
enforced stay at Gallegos.</p>

<p>The next day again brought despondency. The water
seemed to have remained stationary during the night,
and there was a change for the worse in the weather.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
The thick mist which had accompanied daybreak resolved
itself, as the morning wore on, into a steady
heavy rainfall, which seemed grimly resolved to reduce
us to the last stage of misery and discomfort.</p>

<p>We covered up our furs with the packages of feathers,
so as, if possible, to have something dry for bedtime;
and then cowered round the drooping fire in resigned
helplessness, whilst it rained and rained down upon us
with merciless pertinacity.</p>

<p>There is nothing so trying as having to sit hour after
hour in dejected silence, exposed to a cold rain-storm,
which you know may possibly last for days, and from
which you have absolutely no shelter, feeling, as time
goes on, the damp gradually creeping through your
clothes, till it at last reaches the skin and chills you
to the bone, while occasional rills of water run off your
back hair and trickle icily down your shivering neck,
till you are thoroughly drenched and numbed and
cramped with cold.</p>

<p>We passively sat shivering in this wretched plight
till long after noon, getting up now and then to have a
look at the weather or to stretch our stiffened limbs. At
last the clouds began to break up, the storm collected its
dying force in one last fierce downpour, and then ceased
altogether, giving us just time to dry our clothes and
bodies with the aid of a good fire before night came on.</p>

<p>The days dragged their slow length along, and at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
last a week, which, in the weariness of eternally watching
and waiting, seemed more like a month, had gone
past without any signs of a speedy abatement in the
height of the river. The waters had fallen, it is true,
and were still falling, but how slowly and sluggishly!</p>

<p>Day after day I used to climb up the tall escarpment
bounding the northern plain, from the top of which a
good view was to be obtained of the valley, which was
now one vast sheet of water, dotted here and there with
green islands, a long line of foam showing where the
course of the river lay. There I would sit for hours,
watching how little tufts of grass would gradually enlarge
into islands, which in their turn would slowly
grow and grow till they joined and formed part of the
mainland, which was slowly but steadily reclaiming its
lost domains from the retreating waters. This was my
only occupation; I had no heart to join Isidoro on his
frequent hunting expeditions; the river was my sole
thought, the only topic of conversation in which I could
take any interest, and beside that everything else was
of the utmost indifference.</p>

<p>It was not that I had any actual fear of losing the
steamer of the 30th, especially after the eighth day of
our sojourn, during which the water had fallen with
such surprising quickness that the banks of the river
were in some parts beginning to uncover again. Still,
occasionally, the fact that it was just within the limits
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
of possibility that I might not be able to pass in time
would obtrude itself unpleasantly on my mind; and
though I would immediately triumphantly argue any
such idea away, yet I felt that nothing was absolutely
sure till we were actually on the other side of the river,
and, pending that event, I was in a continual state of
worry and restlessness.</p>

<p>When we had been nine days at GuaraikÃ©, as that
part of Gallegos is called by the Indians, Isidoro suggested,
in view of the late rapid fall of the water, that
we should go to another pass, some forty miles further
up the river, which he thought might perhaps be fordable
before the one we were now at.</p>

<p>Any change was welcome to me; I had got to know
and grow weary of every line, every curve of the
country, every stone almost, round our present camp,
and leaving them seemed a step towards crossing the
river. It was, therefore, with a comparatively light
heart that I helped to drive up, pack, and saddle the
horses, and soon we were off for the 'Paso del Medio,'
or Middle Pass, as it is called.</p>

<p>As usual there was a boisterous wind blowing upon
the plains, though far colder and sharper than any we
had as yet experienced. In fact, the weather, instead
of daily growing warmer, had been steadily becoming
colder and colder, and of late snow-squalls had become
of quite frequent occurrence.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span></p>

<p>Several hours' riding brought us to the Middle Pass.
Before camping we rode down to inspect the state of
the water. At GuaraikÃ© we had been unable to approach
the river itself, as all the land on our side had
been flooded over; but here at one spot the river bent
in towards the northern side of the valley, and flowed
for some distance along a steep cliff, which, of course,
it could not overflow, and we were thus enabled to go
down to its very brink, which was in so far satisfactory
as it enabled us to gauge with more exactness the rise
or fall of the flood.</p>

<p>I drove a stake into the bank, and notched it at
the water's level, and then we went back to a bush we
selected for camping under. It was rather a small one,
and, being upon the plain, was exposed to the full force
of the wind. However, it was the most suitable place
we could find, and with the aid of some drift-wood,
quantities of which were lying along the banks of the
river, we managed to build up a kind of one-walled hut,
which formed a tolerable shelter against the wind. The
latter, during the whole of my stay in Patagonia, blew
almost uninterruptedly from the west, either more or less
cold, according as it came from the north-west or south-west.</p>

<p>That evening we ate our last biscuit; our other provisions
had already been exhausted, and henceforward
we were reduced to a regimen of guanaco and ostrich-meat,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
<i>pur et simple</i>, without salt even, for our small
stock of that necessary, notwithstanding careful nursing,
had also gradually thinned away. At first the results of
this exclusively meat diet were very unpleasant. However
much I would eat at a meal&mdash;and the quantity of meat I
consumed at times was incredible&mdash;half an hour afterwards
I would feel as famished as if I had touched
nothing for days; in fact, I seemed to derive no nourishment
at all from my food. As time went on, however,
I got more used to the change, and soon ceased to experience
so phenomenal and troublesome an appetite,
though, of course, I grew very weak, and had it not been for
the ostriches' eggs we occasionally found, and which kept
up my stamina a little, I should not have had sufficient
strength to support me through the exertions I was subsequently
called upon to make.</p>

<p>It became quite an important event when, as now and
then happened, we managed to kill a puma, as we were
then enabled to indulge in fat meat. On these occasions,
I remember, I used to feel rather disgusted at the
voracity with which we all used to gorge ourselves on
the fat, without biscuit, salt, or any other condiment.
But when one passes days and days, eating nothing but
the leanest and most tasteless of meat, and more especially
in cold weather, one feels a hankering for fat, as
strong as the habitual drunkard's craving for alcohol.</p>

<p>The day after our arrival at the Paso del Medio, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
waters commenced to retire at a rapid pace, and such
improvement shortly took place in the state of things,
that we quite looked forward to being able to cross in
three or four days.</p>

<p>The water had disappeared everywhere except in close
vicinity to the river, which still looked of formidable
breadth, however, though its banks were for the most
part uncovered. We had had several sharp frosts, and
the weather had continued bitterly cold, to which fortunate
circumstance we attributed the corresponding
speedy abatement in the water. But now came two
successive days of warm sunshine, and, though the
water still continued to fall, Isidoro grew apprehensive
of a fresh thaw taking place in the Cordilleras, before
the effects of the first flood had subsided sufficiently to
allow of our passing the river.</p>

<p>This new danger threatening us gave me extreme
uneasiness. I had already observed how sensitive the
river was to the state of the temperature, its fall varying
in measure as the weather, in the preceding one or two
days, had been more or less cold, and I therefore looked
doubtfully forward to the morrow for the effects of the
before-mentioned comparatively warm days.</p>

<p>Our apprehensions were unfortunately but too well
founded. The next day I had no need to go down to
examine the notch on the stake, to find out whether the
river had fallen or risen. Without leaving our camp,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
which was at some distance from the valley, one could
see but too plainly that a fresh flood had taken place
during the night. The banks of the river had disappeared,
and half the valley was under water again.
Thus one night had undone all the progress of several
days, and our chances of crossing the river had become
as problematical as they had been ten days ago.</p>

<p>This was a heavy, disheartening blow to me. Now
it was indeed difficult to foresee when we might be able
to pass. Any attempt at calculating the event was
gratuitous in the face of what had just happened. The
water might rise and fall in the same manner a dozen
times. The unusual fall of snow that winter might
entail, and had in fact already entailed, unusual consequences.
We might be kept waiting for weeks, and
months even, during which my friends would be kept
in a state of great anxiety and suspense as to my fate;
and, apart from these considerations, now that the charm
of novelty had worn off, the life of hardship and isolation
I was leading had become extremely distasteful to
me; a deep <i>ennui</i> fell upon me, which I could not shake
off, and which the society of my companions was not
calculated to dissipate. I impatiently longed for those
refinements and associations of civilisation, from which,
at the outset of my trip, I had thought it pleasant to
escape.</p>

<p>Under the influence of all these feelings I resolved
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
to attempt to swim the river. On the first day of our
arrival at GuaraikÃ© I had seriously entertained this
plan, but I had then rejected it as being attended with
considerable danger, and also because I had hoped that
in a few days the river might be fordable. The danger
was now, of course, still greater; but the prospect of an
indefinite prolongation of my present unbearable position
was so terrible that I felt ready for any enterprise, however
risky, which might free me from it.</p>

<p>Guillaume, to whom I communicated my intentions,
thought my idea was practicable, and declared himself
ready to accompany me whenever I chose. He, too,
was anxious to get to Sandy Point for several reasons,
of which the chief one was that he had no tobacco left,
and life without it, he seemed to think, was not worth
living.</p>

<p>It was now the 18th October, and if we crossed the
river by the 26th we had plenty of time to get to Sandy
Point by the 1st November, on or about which day the
next steamer passed for Buenos Ayres. We therefore
deferred the carrying out of our plans for a few days, in
order to await a fresh fall in the water.</p>

<p>I felt much more tranquil now that I had made up
my mind to take the bull by the horns, and my companions
were surprised at the sudden change of my
spirits, which henceforward were more cheerful and
buoyant than they had been for a long time.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<p>We stopped two days longer at the Paso del Medio,
and then, tormented with continual restlessness, we
moved thirty miles further up, to the last pass, called
the 'Paso de Alquinta.'</p>

<p>We camped at about six miles from the pass itself,
under shelter of what Isidoro, rather grandiloquently,
persisted in calling a 'house,' but which was in reality
nothing but three low walls, barely four feet high,
built by some Indian traders of blocks of lava, the chinks
between which were stopped with mud and grass.</p>

<p>The 'house' was, of course, roofless, and by no means
so good a lodging as a thick bush would have been; but
still it was better than nothing, and at all events
enabled us to have always a good fire burning without
consuming too much fuel&mdash;a very important consideration,
as there was very little wood to be met with anywhere
in that region.</p>

<p>During the first night there was a heavy fall of snow,
and on waking I felt an unusual weight on my furs, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
under them an
excessive
warmth I was
certainly not
accustomed to.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_132.jpg" width="550" height="245" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Thrusting
out my head
I found everything
covered
with snow.
The distant
hills stood out
in glittering
relief against
the dark grey
sky, and the
whole landscape
was
specklessly
white, except
where the river
flowed along
the valley,
looking inky
black by contrast
with the
surrounding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
country. Our horses, poor animals, plentifully besprinkled
with snow, too, were standing near to the
camp, herded motionless together, with sadly drooping
heads, and an expression of patient suffering and forlorn
misery in their rough faces, which filled me with compassion
for them.</p>

<p>We remained in bed till the afternoon, when the
snow began to thaw away, soaking all our bedding and
making things generally uncomfortable for us.</p>

<p>Fearing the effect the melting of the recent snow
might have on the river, we resolved to make an
attempt to cross it the following morning. Isidoro, to
whom we now communicated our intention for the first
time, seemed quite alarmed at the idea, and did everything
in his power to persuade us to desist from it.
Until this occasion, I had never been able to get more
than half a dozen words out of him at a time; but now,
in his efforts to induce us to give up our undertaking,
which he qualified as an act of utter madness, he waxed
quite eloquent, and made a longer speech than he had
probably ever delivered himself of in his whole existence.
The current, he urged, was too strong for our
horses to stem; moreover, a companion of his, he told
us, had once tried to cross the river when it was not
nearly so swollen as now, and had narrowly escaped
being drowned. Finding, however, that we had made
up our minds, and were not to be persuaded to alter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
them, Isidoro relapsed into his usual silence, whilst we
made our preparations for the ensuing day.</p>

<p>We intended crossing over at sunrise, so as to have
ample time to dry our wet things on the other side
before night-time. In order to be able to rely on having
something dry to cover ourselves with immediately after
our swim over, we rolled two capas up as tightly as
possible, and stuffed them into a small water-tight canvas
bag. In the middle of the capas we carefully placed our
greatest treasure&mdash;twelve wax matches in a little tortoise-shell
box, which we rendered impervious to damp
by securely wrapping it in pieces of guanaco hide.</p>

<p>Of matches, I must mention, we had run short, as of
everything else, and were compelled to be most economical
in the use of the few that still remained to us, to
which end the fire was kept burning day and night.
We put into our saddle-bags sufficient ostrich meat and
puma fat to last us for three days&mdash;the time we calculated
we should require to reach Sandy Point in. Guillaume
intended leaving his dogs with Isidoro, as they
would suffer unnecessarily from the fatigue of such a
rapid journey.</p>

<p>Having concluded our preparations, we sat down to
dinner, over which we discussed our chances for the
morrow, and arranged our plan of action. There were
two ways of crossing over&mdash;either we might swim over
on horseback, or put our clothes and things on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
horses and make them swim over first, and then follow
ourselves as soon as they had safely arrived on the
opposite shore.</p>

<p>The objection to the first method was that the horses'
strength might possibly give way in the middle of the
river, or that by some accident we might be unseated
at a distance from the shore, in either of which cases,
encumbered with our clothes, etc., we were almost
certain to be drowned. The difficulty which presented
itself in connection with the second method was the
doubt we felt as to whether we should be able to stand
a long immersion in the icy-cold water without succumbing
to cramp and exhaustion, especially taking
into consideration the weak state our late poor diet had
reduced us to. After a long discussion, we finally
adopted the plan of swimming over on horseback.</p>

<p>We went to bed early, but it was a long time before
I could fall asleep; I was too excited with the thoughts
of the coming struggle. At last I was to try conclusions
with the river, which had so long baffled me. If
successful, four nights from then I should be at Sandy
Point, sure of my steamer, relieved from the hardships
I was now suffering, and soon to be restored to civilisation,
for which I was longing as ardently as an Indian,
confined to the close, noisy streets of a populous town,
might long for the breezy solitudes of the pampa. In
my dreams that night I must have crossed the river
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
twenty times at least, and I was splashing in the midst
of its cold current for the twenty-first time, when Guillaume
woke me up, to tell me it was time to get ready.</p>

<p>Day was just breaking, and the weather was cloudy
and cold. We ate a hurried breakfast, saddled our
horses, and rode down towards the pass, which was
about six miles from where we were camping. On the
way we had to cross the open, and came full under the
blast of the bitter wind, which was especially sharp at
that early hour; and we were blue and shivering long
before we got to the river. There was unfortunately
no sun, though I would have given anything for a sight
of his cheering face to keep up my <i>morale</i>, which, I
must confess, at the prospect of a cold and dangerous
plunge on that wintry morning, had sunk extremely
low. Presently we reached the river, and never, I
thought, had it seemed so broad or looked so unpleasantly
dark and treacherous as now. Its eddying
current slid past us with a rapidity which made me
giddy to watch long. The water foamed viciously as
it broke into waves, and showers of spray, swept up by
occasional gusts of wind, flew over its troubled surface.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_137.jpg" width="550" height="472" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Without further delay, we said good-bye to Isidoro,
tightened our saddle-girths, and rode towards the point
from which we intended starting. There we paused a
moment before taking the decisive step forward&mdash;a
moment of extreme nervous tension for both of us. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
felt an oppressive contraction of the throat and chest,
which, to be candid, I must attribute to a passing feeling
of fear that came over me at the last moment, now
that I was about to commit myself, not without serious
misgivings as to the consequences, to the mercies of
the broad torrent which had so long baffled my progress.
However, remembering that the longer one looks at
a leap the less one likes to take it, I called out to
Guillaume that I was ready, and with spur and whip
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
we urged our horses down the steep bank towards the
water.</p>

<p>For a moment, rearing and snorting, they instinctively
recoiled from the dangerous element, but the
pebbly bank giving way under their feet, they could not
stop themselves, and down we went&mdash;plunge!&mdash;head
over ears into the cold water. I came to the surface
snapping for breath, but still in the saddle, though the
water, dripping over my eyes, for a second or two quite
blinded me.</p>

<p>After a little urging, the horses at first struck out
right enough, but I found that to keep my seat the
greatest exertions were required. Till then I had never
swum on horseback, and had no idea how difficult it is
to remain in the saddle during the process. The water
insinuates itself cunningly between your knees and
thighs, imperceptibly you lose your grip, and, before you
know it, you are gently lifted from your seat, and find
yourself afloat, especially when dealing with a current
as strong as the one in question.</p>

<p>In the meantime, our horses went all right till they
came to the middle current, which swept down with
great force. The moment they felt it they suddenly
swerved, and made for the bank we had just left. I
tried to make my horse turn again, but it became quite
unmanageable, and Guillaume in a similar attempt was
unseated, and was only able to regain his saddle after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
a severe struggle, which I watched with intense anxiety,
as I was unable to go to his rescue, being myself in
difficulties.</p>

<p>Breathless and dripping, and humiliated with the
consciousness of our failure, we finally got to shore
again, and, after a hasty council, resolved to make
another attempt the following day, as, after the facer
we had just received, our nerves were not equal to
another ordeal for the present. As long as the excitement
of the danger lasted, we had felt neither wet nor
cold, but now that it was over Nature re-asserted herself,
and, drenched to the skin as we were, and exposed
to the blasts of a savagely inclement wind, we were
completely prostrated, quaking, and shivering, and in
such a state that it would have been mere foolhardiness
to go into the water again. The six-miles' ride back
to the camp in our wet clothes was another disagreeable
trial. By the time we got there we were perfectly
numbed, and had to warm our stiffened fingers a
long time by the fire before they were sufficiently supple
to enable us to undress. Having stripped, I rolled
myself in my capa, and, thanks to that never-sufficiently-to-be-praised
covering, warmth and circulation
were soon restored to my chilled limbs. We had, unfortunately,
no matÃ© left, though on this occasion we stood
more than ever in need of its stimulating and restorative
aid.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span></p>

<p>Notwithstanding our failure, we were by no means
disheartened, or disposed to relinquish our endeavours
to cross the river; on the contrary, the non-success of
our first attempt only intensified my firm resolve to
reach Sandy Point, come what might, by the 1st of
November, and nerved us to a fresh encounter with
the dangers of the river and the inclemency of the
weather.</p>

<p>The next morning we again made the attempt, and
were again unsuccessful as before. The horses went
well till they got to the rapid middle current, and there
nothing would induce them to continue. In the
struggle with my horse I was swept from my seat. I
caught successively at the mane and saddle, but missed
them both, just managing to catch hold of a valise that
was strapped to the back of the latter. I clung to it
like grim death, whilst my horse swam back to the
bank. Several times I was in danger of being dragged
under by the current, and the valise, under the strain
of my weight, began gradually to give way. When it
did come down, saddle and all, we were fortunately
already in shallow water, and I came to no harm;
though it was lucky it held so long, for, heavily booted
and clothed as I was, had it happened a little sooner, I
should have gone to the bottom.</p>

<p>We rode disconsolately back to the camp, suffering
extremely from the cold wind, as on the previous day.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
It was useless, we had now convinced ourselves, to
swim over on our horses, for as soon as we came to the
middle current we were at their mercy. We therefore
resolved to try the other expedient, of driving them
over first, and then following ourselves.</p>

<p>For topographical reasons we considered the pass at
GuaraikÃ© to be more favourable for this mode of crossing
than the one we were now at, and we therefore resolved
to go there. We said good-bye once more to Isidoro,
who preferred remaining where he was, as there was
better pasturage for his horses. We took enough meat
with us to last us four days, and leaving the dogs with
Isidoro we started off for GuaraikÃ©, where we arrived
late in the evening, after a long gallop.</p>

<p>We did not camp on the old spot, but rode further
down to a little 'house' Guillaume knew of, similar
to the one at the Paso de Alquinta, but with rather
higher walls, and which had also been built by some
Indian traders.</p>

<p>We ate a very small supper, as it was necessary to
economise the little meat we had with us, consoling
ourselves with the hope of soon being able to indulge
in less meagre fare, and finally we went to bed, confident
of passing the next night on the other side of the
Gallegos.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<p>Early the next morning we were up and off to the
river. To get to its banks we had to ride through
about a mile and a half of slack water, of varying depth,
but seldom above the knees of our horses. Near the
river there was a dry spot on a tract of high-lying land,
and there accordingly we made our preparations. We
took off our clothes, and placed them, together with the
matches, revolvers, etc., in the middle of the capas,
which were rolled up in the canvas bag, as on the
previous occasions, and then carefully and firmly
strapped on the saddle of one of the horses. All this
was done as quickly as possible, for we were now, of
course, almost naked, and the wind, as usual, was blowing
hard and cold, with mingled hail and snow. We had
little doubt as to the success of this our third effort.
Indeed, we had, as it were, cut off our own retreat, in
putting all our clothes and furs on the horses, for if
they once got safely to the other side, we were of a
necessity forced to follow somehow, or expose ourselves
to the alternative of perishing with hunger and cold.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
It was a foolhardy action, but we had become desperate,
and were ready to run a slight risk, if only we could
surmount the hated obstacle which barred our way to
Sandy Point.</p>

<p>Everything being ready, we drove the horses, not
without great difficulty, into the water, following ourselves
as far as we were able, though such was the force
of the current that we had hardly waded in knee-deep
before we were knocked off our feet. After immense
trouble, with the help of stones and sticks, we managed
to drive the horses into the middle current, down whose
centre they were soon swept, puffing and snorting and
endeavouring to turn back towards the bank we were
standing on. Whenever they did so, however, we would
fling a volley of stones at them, and by these means at
last we got them to head towards the other bank. We
watched their progress with beating hearts, in painful
suspense lest any accident should happen to them; for
they carried, as it were, our lives as well as their
own. After a few seconds, which seemed an eternity to
us, they reached the land, and we gave a shout of joy
and relief. But our triumph was of but a second's
duration; fate was still against us. As ill-luck would
have it, the horses happened just to touch land with
their noses at a part where the bank was almost vertical,
and where they consequently had no footing. Instinctively
they turned round and made straight for our
side again.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span></p>

<p>Dismayed and disappointed, we no longer made any
attempt to drive them back; indeed, we were against
the current, they would not have strength to get back
again. At last they landed, however, though of course
a long way down from where they had started. We
ourselves by this time were in a most pitiable state; for
more than half an hour we had been splashing in and
out of the icy-cold water, exposed to wind and weather,
and we were now thoroughly exhausted, our teeth chattering,
our bodies doubled up, and unable to speak to
one another except by signs.</p>

<p>We had just strength enough to get the capas out of
the bag, the inner ones being fortunately quite dry; and
wrapping ourselves well up, we lay down for about an
hour, by which time we were sufficiently recovered to
be able to remount our horses and ride back to the
camp.</p>

<p>We were now at last discouraged. An unexpected
stroke of bad luck, a mishap we could not possibly have
foreseen, had occurred just at the last moment, and
spoiled everything, converting what had appeared a certain
triumph into a disastrous failure. If the horses had
only happened to touch land ten feet further up, or ten
feet further down, where the bank was less steep, by
this time we might have been on the road to Sandy
Point. But everything seemed to be against us. I had
brought all my energy to this last attempt, the last
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
chance of reaching our destination in time for the
steamer of the 1st November. It had failed, and I felt
unmanned and dispirited. My physical strength, too,
was giving way under these repeated exertions and the
poor diet of the last two weeks.</p>

<p>All these considerations combined, and there being no
immediate necessity for crossing the river now, as the next
steamer did not leave Sandy Point till the 10th November,
made us resolve to wait a few days longer before
risking another attempt at swimming over, especially
as all this time the water had been rapidly decreasing
again; and, judging by the height of the river, we might
now reasonably expect to find it fordable in, at most,
three or four days, always supposing that no new flood
occurred. We had, therefore, merely to closely watch
the river, so as to be ready to cross again if any signs
of a fresh rise should appear.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding that we were now well into spring,
I was surprised to find but little corresponding change
in the weather. Occasionally we had a warm day, but
it was the exception, and was sure to be immediately
followed by unusual cold. The west wind blew almost
unintermittingly, and always with extreme violence. In
fact, with all my memories of Patagonia are closely
associated, as one of the most prominent peculiarities of
its landscapes, the fiercely cold but exhilarating blasts
of that same wild west wind. But though the weather
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
had got but little warmer, there was everywhere a
marked change in the vegetation. The grass in the
glens was gradually becoming fresh and green, and the
bright young leaves of the calafatÃ© bush were interspersed
with bunches of small yellow flowers. Flowers,
too&mdash;red and white orchids, and pink cowslips&mdash;were
springing up amongst the grass; and that none
of the associations of springtime might be wanting,
clouds of tiny little swallows, white-breasted and with
glittering blue wings&mdash;come from Heaven knows where&mdash;were
to be seen skimming through the air in all
directions. Wretched and miserable indeed must be
the spot over which spring can pass without making her
genial influence felt in some way, though it be but in the
transitory brightening of a few poor blades of grass.</p>

<p>It is fortunate that the calafatÃ© is everywhere abundant
in Patagonia, as its wood affords excellent fuel,
being extremely hard and burning very slowly. At
night-time we would cover up the embers well, and
were sure to find them still smouldering in the morning,
and were thus able to economize our matches, of which
we had now but few left.</p>

<p>The valley had become the rendezvous of wild fowl
of all descriptions&mdash;swans, wild geese, ducks, snipe, etc.;
and many a time we regretted not having brought a gun
with us. A roast goose now and then would have made
a welcome improvement on our eternal diet of lean
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
guanaco and ostrich. A bevy of ibis, or 'bandurria,' as
the Chilians call them, used to make a point every
evening of assembling close to our camp, and lifting up
their voices and quacking till an hour or so after sundown.
Their note resembles that of the duck, though
it is rather shorter and drier. They seemed to know,
confound them! that they had nothing to fear from us,
and would let us come quite near enough to enable us
to see how provokingly fat they all were. The Indians
call the wild geese of those parts 'kay-kÃ©n,' in imitation
of its cry, which has a rather melancholy sound,
and which was always sounding in our ears, morning,
noon, and evening, repeated by a thousand throats in
lengthened and mournful cadences. All these wild
fowl remain in the southern valleys till their young are
fledged, and then as the warm weather comes on they
fly north, and play havoc among the rich corn-fields of
the Rio Negro.</p>

<p>Two days went by, and we began to find ourselves
running short of meat, our stock having only been
calculated to last for four days, as we had made our
provision on the assumption of reaching Sandy Point by
that time. It was, therefore, necessary for Guillaume
to go back to Isidoro to fetch the dogs. As it was a
long distance, being more than 120 miles there and
back, and being anxious to spare our horses as much as
possible, we first went out to see if we could hunt up a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
puma, the only animal one can kill without the aid of
dogs&mdash;the bolas or a revolver being all that is required.</p>

<p>But after a long search we were unsuccessful, and
early the next morning, therefore, Guillaume started off,
leaving a small piece of meat which was to last me till
the evening of the next day, by which time he hoped
to be back.</p>

<p>When he was gone, I saddled my horse and rode up
the CaÃ±ada of the Squaws to collect firewood, as there
was none near our camp. I found it no easy task to
break off the dry branches out of the thorny bushes, or
pull up old roots which were firmly seated in the ground,
in my present weak state, and I was glad when I had
got sufficient wood to last me for that and the following
day. At no period of my sojourn in Gallegos had I felt
so weak as I now did. For three days we had eaten
next to nothing&mdash;in fact, less than I could ordinarily
eat myself at <i>one</i> meal&mdash;and I have already said how
little sustaining power there is even in a large quantity
of lean guanaco or ostrich meat.</p>

<p>When I got back to the camp, I cooked a small piece
of the meat Guillaume had left me, and then carefully
deposited it on the top of one of the walls of the house,
so as to be out of reach of the foxes, who are terrible
marauders, and who will eat your reins, lasso, saddle
even, or any leathern article you may be so incautious
as to leave lying about.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span></p>

<p>Feeling tired, after my frugal meal, which compared to
my hunger was but as a drop in the ocean, I lay down
on my furs and dosed off into a sound sleep, from which
I was presently awakened by a confusion of strange
screeching and flapping of wings. Starting up, I found
the noise proceeded from some carranchos, who were
quarrelling over my meat, or rather over the bone, which
was all that I found of it, after I had driven them away
with stones and strong language. '<i>Incidit in Scyllam</i>,'
etc. In my endeavours to secure my food from the
foxes, I had delivered it into the beaks and claws of the
carranchos, and felt not a little annoyed at my own
carelessness. It was no pleasant matter having to fast
for the next thirty hours, hungry as I already was, and
if Guillaume by some possible accident were detained a
day longer, I might find myself in a very serious plight.
I was evidently out of luck, and that with a vengeance,
and I began to wonder what my next mishap would be.
The only misfortune that could now happen to me was
that my horse might take it into his head to run away,
and then I should indeed be in a desperate fix. He
was quietly grazing at the time, but the idea of such a
possibility so startled me that I immediately tied a
lasso to his halter and secured it to a huge stone near
the house, so as to prevent any such untoward eventuality.
Then, feeling hungry, I commenced to search
my traps for any stray piece of meat that might possibly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
have been forgotten there. All I could find was a
small piece of puma fat, wrapped up in a piece of linen,
in a coat-pocket of Guillaume's, which had doubtless
been intended for greasing the dog's paws when wounded,
for which purpose it is considered an excellent specific.
To me, under my present circumstances, however, it
was quite a treasure, and I immediately cooked and ate
half, keeping the rest for the next day.</p>

<p>Having made all my arrangements for passing the
night, I made a good fire, as it was very cold, and wrapping
myself up well in my capa, I sat down beside it,
waiting as stoically as I could for night-time, and trying
to forget, amidst the splendour of the sunset, the small
sharp whisper of the little voice within my stomach.</p>

<p>From the slight elevation where I was now sitting I
could overlook the whole of the surrounding country&mdash;the
far hills and plains; the winding valley shut in by
steep cliffs, past whose base the river swept its tortuous
course; the broad lakes formed by the overflow of
its waters, dotted everywhere with green islands, where
thousands of wild fowl were now assembled&mdash;the harsh
cries of the gulls and the plaintive note of the kay-kÃ©n
being the only sounds that broke the otherwise intense
silence. Over all the setting sun was pouring his last
rays, bathing the distant hills in a warm haze, and burnishing
the waters at my feet with fiery showers of
light, and lending, with his magic tints of red and gold,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
a transitory gleam of grace and beauty even to that wild
desert spot.</p>

<p>But as the sun went down the charm sped with him.
The glory departed from the distant hills, and they
became grey and cold as before; the light faded from
the valley, the waters assumed a muddy hue, and the
islands blackened on their surface. The cry of the
wild fowl slowly ceased, and below me, soon, all was
silent and dark.</p>

<p>The stars crept out one by one, and still I sat by the
red gleams of the dying fire, listening to the whispering
voices of the night-wind and watching the weird,
ghostly shapes occasionally assumed by the white mist
that now hung over the valley, as it swayed mysteriously
to and fro, like a band of unquiet spirits.</p>

<p>The whole thing seemed so unreal, the turn of events
so fantastic, which had brought me, a child of noisy
towns and bustling marts, into my strange position,
alone in that immense solitude&mdash;the wildness of the
scene, starlit and dim, the strange noises of the night,
the thousand sounds which yet seemed silence&mdash;I
thought it must all be a dream, and most surely I must
awaken and find myself in my own room, under warm
bedclothes, with the voice of the servant with my
shaving-water ringing in my ears.</p>

<p>But a shiver of cold which went through my body,
and the strong pangs of hunger, were quite sufficient to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
remind me of the reality of all around me; so, heaping
some more wood on the fire and giving another look to
see if the horse was secure, I sought my couch, to sleep
as best I might till morning.</p>

<p>A sharp frost fell during the night, much to my satisfaction,
as I had now strong hopes of crossing the river
in a couple of days. Having satisfied myself that the
water was still falling rapidly&mdash;always my first task of
a morning&mdash;I cooked and ate the remaining piece of
puma fat, and then, still feeling terribly hungry, and as
a means of killing time till Guillaume should come, I
tried to stalk wild geese with my revolver. I could
never come within range, however, though they are not
very shy, and finally gave up this unexciting and
unproductive sport in a rather unpleasant state of
mind, as I began to ask myself what I should do if
Guillaume should happen not to come back that day.</p>

<p>Casting my eyes about, they happened to fall on a
large island in the middle of the valley, which had
often attracted our attention on account of its being
the rendezvous of a bevy of swans, which we imagined
must have nests and eggs there, and we had often
meditated a raid on the latter. Hitherto we had been
hindered from doing so, because the island was surrounded
for a long distance by very deep water, which,
as may be imagined, was quite sufficient to keep the
swans' eggs safe from us as long as anything else could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
be found to eat. Since we had last surveyed the defences
of the island, however, the water had fallen very
much, and it occurred to me, in my present stress, that
by carefully searching I might find a tolerably dry
road to the island. I accordingly saddled my horse,
and set out on my exploration. After a great deal of
splashing and several narrow escapes of tumbling into
holes, varied by occasional energetic protests from my
horse&mdash;who, by-the-bye, after all his late experience
and his daily three or four rides through the water to
examine the river, must have thought I was trying to
convert him into an amphibious animal&mdash;I at last
managed to discover a route which was almost practicable,
and which by the next day, when the water
would have fallen still further, would probably be
thoroughly so. I could distinctly see several swans
sitting on their nests, to whom I waved a light <i>au
revoir</i>, and then returned to the camp, feeling that
even if Guillaume were not to come back that day, I
now knew where to find my dinner, although at the
expense of a slight wetting.</p>

<p>However, I fortunately had no necessity for incurring
that inconvenience; for, towards five o'clock, just as&mdash;despairing
of his return&mdash;I was getting ready to swim
over to the island, I descried him galloping towards the
camp. He presently arrived, bringing the dogs, some
meat, and four ostriches' eggs he had found on the way.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span></p>

<p>Famished as I was after my long fast, I lost no time
in spitting some meat and setting it to roast, busying
myself whilst it was cooking with the preparation of an
ostrich's egg <i>Ã  la Patagonienne</i>. The process is as
follows: You break a small round hole in the top of
the egg, and after having removed some of the white,
which is rather heavy for the stomach, and having
thoroughly beaten up the yolk, you set the egg on its
end in the ashes, at a little distance from the fire, carefully
turning it now and then to prevent the shell from
cracking. Whilst cooking, it must occasionally be removed
from the fire, and the batter must be stirred well,
or else it will stick to the sides of the shell and burn.
In a quarter of an hour it will be well roasted; add
pepper and salt, if you have any, and serve. Our stock
of these useful condiments had unfortunately long been
exhausted. Cooked in this way, ostriches' eggs are
excellent, and far better than when boiled. The act of
removing and placing them near the fire whilst roasting
requires great nimbleness of finger. I had, during my
noviciate, two standing sores or burns on forefinger and
thumb, as I would sometimes cook as many as three or
four eggs a day. They are held to be very indigestible,
two eggs eaten in a day being said to endanger a man's
life; but the foregoing is a proof to the contrary. I
have known Guillaume to eat six eggs in the space of
eight hours, independent of his ordinary meals. It is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
true his powers were beyond the usual run, even of
those of his own habits and profession.</p>

<p>In the conversation which ensued, when I had in
some degree allayed the pangs of hunger, Guillaume
told me that on his way down he had paid a flying visit
to the Middle Pass, the result of which was that he
considered it the best place to cross over, in case, contrary
to our present expectations, we should again be
obliged to swim for it. The banks on the other side
were all low-lying, and there would consequently be no
danger of a repetition of the accident which had prevented
us from crossing over at the pass we were now
at. In return for this information, I told him of my
discovery of a road to the island; and, eggs being almost
indispensable to us for keeping up our failing strength,
for which the meat alone was quite inadequate, we
resolved to make a raid on the nests the following
morning.</p>

<p>Shortly after daybreak, therefore, we set out towards
the island, each of us armed with a stick and a revolver
in case the birds, which are said to be very savage,
should think fit to resent our seizure of their eggs. The
road to the island was not as favourable as it had appeared
to me the day before, and we got soaked up to
the waist in crossing over; but, in the excitement of
the chase, we took little notice of that. Long before
we arrived, a commotion was visible amongst the inmates
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
of the island; several male swans, and crowds of
wild geese and other fowl, flew up and hovered over us,
watching our onward course with signs of marked disapproval.
The female birds, however, kept their seats
till we were within ten yards of them, and then rose
with a hissing cry and much flapping of wings, circling
over our heads, and occasionally gliding close to us,
whilst we were despoiling their nests, though without
making any attempt at attacking us. We found eight
swans' nests, containing each four eggs, besides some
forty wild geese's eggs. To mitigate the distress of the
birds, we left one egg in each nest, and with the rest of
our booty returned to the camp in triumph. Whilst
our wet clothes were drying by the fire, wrapped in our
capas, we set to and commenced roasting some swans'
eggs. They are about half the size of ostriches' eggs,
and of a similar taste. Amongst the other eggs were
some of a species of duck, which to my taste seemed
incomparably finer than the best bantam's, and, as may
be imagined, we were not slow in doing full justice to
them.</p>

<p>At five o'clock I mounted my horse, and rode leisurely
towards the river, as was my habit, in order to watch
the progress of its gradual decrease, which, as I have
already said, had been very satisfactory lately. But to-night,
already from afar I was startled by the appearance
of the banks, which seemed to me lower than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
usual. The mark confirmed my fears. The water had
risen more than two inches. In deep dismay I galloped
back to the camp, and told Guillaume the bad news.
For a moment the blow left us bewildered. Experience
had taught us that one night would suffice to flood the
river as high as it had been before. It seemed as if we
were again to be thrown back a fortnight. It was time
to adopt some decisive measures. Late as it was, I suggested
that we should ride off that very night to the
Middle Pass, and swim across at daybreak, be the river
as it might. There was no time to lose in indecision,
and half an hour after I proposed this plan, we had
packed up our things, saddled the horses, and were once
more on the march. The sun was setting as we
emerged from Gallegos valley into the plain, and before
long it was quite dark. It was midnight when we
arrived at the old camp at the Middle Pass, cold and
blue, after a long buffeting with our old enemy, the
wind. Tired as we were, we had to collect wood to
make a fire with, in order to warm ourselves by, before
we could get to sleep.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<p>The morning broke, as it always did whenever we tried
to cross the river, bleakly and coldly. The river had
risen considerably during the night, and was still rising
rapidly. Previous to our other arrangements, we fixed
on a site from which to start ourselves, after the horses
should once be safely across.</p>

<p>The chief danger in passing the river lay in the possibility
of the middle current being too strong for us to
stem, in which case we should of necessity be swept
along with it, without being able to reach either bank,
until, our strength giving way under the combined influence
of the cold and our exertions, we should ultimately
perish. The spot we chose seemed to obviate
this danger, as a little way down the opposite bank
made a broad curve, forming a point which shot for a
long way into the river. I could see that the current
followed the curve, running inside the point. By committing
ourselves, therefore, to the current at some distance
above the point, we must of necessity, I argued,
bring up in the little bay formed by the curve above-mentioned,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
in which case the point would act as an
effectual bar to our being swept down the centre of the
river. All this seemed plausible enough; but we were
reckoning without our host, however, as I presently
discovered, and in ignorance of the course taken by the
current, which did not, as we supposed, always follow
the bend of the banks or keep in the centre of the river,
where the water was deepest, but darted about
capriciously, without apparently depending on any topographical
influences, though no doubt it did.</p>

<p>We first made a large fire near the river, to warm
ourselves by whilst packing and saddling the horses, so
that the caloric of our bodies should not be all exhausted,
as on the last occasion, before we had to make
the final struggle, when we should have most need of it.
It proved a most providential act; this same fire subsequently
saved my life. We made our preparations in
deep silence, being both too busy with our own thoughts
to say much. We were firmly resolved that, <i>coÃ»te que
coÃ»te</i>, this was to be our last effort. We had the usual
difficulty to induce the horses to enter the water. Once
in, however, they were soon seized by the current and
swept down the river. We watched their course with
the most intense anxiety. At first it seemed that they
could not stem the current, which was evidently stronger
than it had been at our last attempt. For a moment we
held our breath in painful suspense, but gradually they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
began to gain towards the opposite bank, and presently
we saw them emerge safe and sound from the water,
though the distance they had been carried down showed
what the strength of the current must be.</p>

<p>Everything now depended on ourselves. The supreme
moment had come, and not a second was to be lost, for
already I began to feel numb with the cold. On the
other side were our clothes, our furs, our matches&mdash;our
existence, in fact. Between us lay the river. We must
cross it; there was no alternative. I ran as quickly as
possible towards the place we had chosen for starting
from, not daring to look at the river on the way, lest my
courage should fail me now that I most required its aid.
I had to wade for some distance through a sheet of
shallow water before reaching the river itself. It only
came up to my waist, which made it colder than if I
had been completely immersed, and the wind was
piercing all the time to the very marrow of my bones.
Suddenly I fell into a hole, sousing head over ears into
the water. Chilled and breathless with the shock, I
emerged after a short swim, and hurried on my way,
anxious to get it all over. At last I came to the river.
Without pausing a moment, I jumped in, with a feeling
of relief that the worst would now soon be passed. I
struck out with the current, and, as I had foreseen, it
swept me rapidly towards the point. In a few seconds
I was close to the bank. I stretched out my hands to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
clutch at the grass, when, to my horror, the land seemed
suddenly to recede from me again. The current had
swerved off before actually reaching land, and I was
being hurried with fearful swiftness into the middle of
the river. I tried to make for land, but my legs and
arms stiffened, and I seemed to be dragged under the
water. A desperate struggle brought me once more to
the surface. I remember catching a glimpse of the blue
sky, and feeling with sickening terror that I was lost,
and again I sank under.</p>

<p>For a second or two I think I must have been unconscious;
when I came to myself again, I felt I was in
warmer water. My strength revived a little, and I
struck out several times towards a bank, close along
which I was being hurried in the direction of another
point a little further down. At times I came so near
the bank that I could actually stretch out my hands
and reach the long grass growing on it, but my fingers,
stiffened with the cold, refused to close on what alone
could save me from being swept away again. It was a
horrible moment, for if I passed the next point, I was
indeed lost. I shouted for help, but no one answered;
it almost seemed that I was to be drowned with one
foot on land, so to speak.</p>

<p>Suddenly, however, my feet touched the bottom, and
in another second, carried bodily against the extremity
of the point, I found myself in shallow water, where I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
was able to regain my footing, and take breath once
more. I managed to drag myself up the bank; but on
reaching the top, my strength gave way again, and, overcome
with cold and fatigue, I sank down, utterly prostrate
and helpless. On emerging from the river, a glance
had shown me that ill luck had willed that I should be
thrown up on the same side from which I had started.
Fortunately, I found myself not far distant from the fire
we had made before crossing, and with my remaining
strength I now endeavoured to reach it. I could only
breathe with the greatest difficulty; at times I thought
I must choke. I tried to raise myself up and walk, but
failed; my legs were like lead, all circulation seemed
arrested, and I could only crawl slowly along on all-fours.
Many times I thought I must give in, but with
the energy of despair I struggled on, and at last reached
the fire, which was still burning. Some logs of wood
were lying close to it; I pushed them in, and there was
soon a good blaze. It seemed to give me no warmth,
however, though in my agony I almost thrust my body
into the very flames. Nearly an hour elapsed before
circulation was properly restored, during which I lay
shivering with cold, and gasping for breath in a state of
the most acute suffering.</p>

<p>When I had in some measure recovered, I began to
realise the critical position I was now placed in. Terrible
as the idea was to me after my recent narrow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
escape from drowning, I had no alternative but to
attempt to cross the river again. If I remained where
I was, certain death from starvation or exposure awaited
me; and it was useless to endeavour to reach Isidoro,
who was at least forty miles away, for, naked as I was,
I could not have gone even half a mile upon the plains,
in the teeth of the cold wind, which was, of course, still
blowing. I had all this time thought it strange that
Guillaume had not come to my assistance, as I had
expected that he would have delayed crossing himself
until he had watched the result of my own attempt.
That he had safely crossed, however, now became evident,
for I could see the horses grazing unsaddled on the
opposite side. Where he had crossed, there was no
reason why I should not be able to follow, unless it was
that as he had swum over comparatively fresh and
strong, whereas I had now hardly recovered from the
effects of my first unsuccessful struggle.</p>

<p>It was at worst but a question of taking another
plunge, and then a few seconds would decide one way
or the other, and after all, sooner or later, I should be
forced to cross, as it was simply impossible to remain
where I was. It was better, therefore, I reflected to go
through the ordeal at once, rather than increase its terrors
by long anticipation. Screwing up my courage,
without more ado I started off as quickly as I could, to
look for the place Guillaume had started from. At this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
juncture he himself suddenly appeared on the opposite
bank, and guessing my intention, ran forward and
pointed the exact place out to me. It was much higher
up than where I had started from, and to get to it, as
before, I had to wade through some shallow water, which
now and then was deep enough to oblige me to swim.
When I reached the exact spot, I could easily see why
he had chosen it&mdash;no doubt after having witnessed my
mishap&mdash;for the current ran almost straight across from
where I stood to the other bank, where it broke with
great force, so that there was no danger of my being
swept away from the bank, as before, just as I got up
to it. I had in fact, merely to jump in, and allow myself
to be swept passively over by the current. Notwithstanding
the apparent simplicity and easiness of the
undertaking, I stood for some time looking at the water,
with an instinctive dread, not daring to take the first
step. A man who has just escaped drowning may be
excused from fearing to trust himself, five minutes after,
to the water again. But, feeling a chill come over my
body, and apprehensive lest by further exposing myself
to the air I should bring on a cramp, I nerved myself
for the plunge, and, shutting my eyes and setting my
teeth, I sprang into the water. Once in, all fear left
me, and I struck out boldly, and, aided by the current,
soon reached the opposite shore.</p>

<p>My feelings on finding myself in safety on the Sandy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
Point side of the river may be imagined. All the hardships
I had endured, the reverses I had suffered, the
dangers I had undergone&mdash;all was forgotten in the
triumphant elation of that moment; the fatal obstacle
which had so long retarded our onward march was at
last overcome, and there was nothing to prevent us now
from speedily arriving at our destination.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I staggered through the band of shallow
water which still separated me from Guillaume, who
was waiting for me with a dry capa. With the support
of his arm, I managed to reach a fire he had made
at a little distance from the water, and there I covered
myself with three capas, which restored the warmth
to my body quicker than a thousand fires could have
done.</p>

<p>In about half an hour I was sufficiently recovered to
eat an ostrich-steak, and to listen to Guillaume's account
of what had happened to him since we had last seen
each other. He had watched the course of my ill-fated
attempt, had seen me struggling for life in the water,
and at last disappear altogether; after which, as he had
not seen me return, he had naturally concluded I was
drowned. But his own safety required that he should
not linger any longer, or the horses, finding themselves
left to their own devices, might take it into their heads
to run away with the furs and clothes. It was clear,
too, that he must not commit the same error in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
selection of his starting-point as had brought me into
difficulties, and he had, therefore, followed the course of
the river till he came to the spot I have already described,
and which, as the result proved, possessed the
necessary requirements for insuring his safety. Naturally
enough, with the demoralising impressions of
what he had just witnessed in my case fresh in his
mind, he was not without some unpleasant misgivings
as to the eventual result of his own attempt. He had
crossed with ease, however, and it was in going to look
after the horses that he saw me in the act of creeping
towards the fire on the other side. He certainly had not
thought I should have strength enough to cross the
river again, and had been very much troubled about me,
not knowing in what way to assist me. In the meantime
he had made a good fire, and with the aid of the
wind and sun, which latter had at last come from behind
the clouds, he had thoroughly dried our clothes and furs,
and was just considering what could be done to relieve
me from my perilous plight, when he observed me
running along the opposite shore, with the obvious intention
of once more trying to swim across.</p>

<p>By this time it was about half-past two, and, burning
with the desire to accomplish my journey, I proposed
we should continue our march immediately, as we
might still go a good way on our road before sundown.
I accordingly dressed; we saddled our horses, and soon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
rode out of the valley up to the plain, turning as we
reached the top of the escarpment which bounded the
valley, to have a last look on our vanquished enemy,
the river&mdash;now, thank God, at last behind us&mdash;and
then, facing towards the south-west, we broke into a
brisk gallop, once more <i>en route</i> for Sandy Point.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<p>We presently came to a hilly country, where the plains
were of shorter duration, and cut up in all directions by
steeper and more irregular caÃ±adas than I had hitherto
met; whilst occasionally we passed broad tracts of
scoriÃ¦, which forced us, in consideration of our horses,
to change our gallop for a soberer pace. These tracts
grew more and more frequent as we approached a range
of high hills, at whose base we hoped to camp that
night, though as yet their jagged and fantastic outlines
showed but dimly on the distant horizon.</p>

<p>We passed several herds of guanacos, who fled away
at our approach. Presently, however, one solitary
animal, whose curiosity was stronger than its good
sense, came neighing and frisking around us, halting at
last almost under our very noses. The voice of his
master had hitherto kept back our remaining dog (the
other had refused to cross the river); but this was
rather more than he could stand, and darting out from
behind our horses, where he had hitherto very unwillingly
kept himself, he flew out at the startled guanaco,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
who, on seeing him, gave an affrighted bound, and
stretched away over the plain with the speed of lightning.
The dog followed pretty close on its heels. Our
blood was up, and we dashed after them as fast as the
horses would carry us, to aid the dog in case he should
turn the guanaco round our way. For a moment they
ran pretty evenly, but then the guanaco, evidently a
tough old male, gradually distanced his pursuer, though
the latter was a remarkably swift dog, and of very good
breed. We were just despairing of the chase, when it
suddenly became apparent that the guanaco was in
difficulties, his flight having been arrested by a belt of
marshy ground, where his heavy weight immediately
put him at a great disadvantage. The very efforts he
made to redouble the force of his bounds only caused
his sharp hoofs to sink deeper into the heavy soil; and
in a few seconds the dog, whose speed was not so much
affected by the nature of the ground, had reached
his now helpless prey, and flown at his throat. We
soon came up to them, and Guillaume, dismounting,
despatched the guanaco with his long hunting-knife.</p>

<p>After all, the game turned out to be not worth the
candle, or rather the sunlight we had lost in its pursuit,
for it proved to be as lean of flesh as it had been swift
of foot. We, therefore, merely stayed to cut off and
secure its head, and then resumed our journey with all
speed, as the sun was already getting low, and we had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
still a long ride before us. Fate, however, seemed
determined to prevent us reaching our intended halting-place
that night. Not long after the guanaco-hunt an
ostrich started up, so close to us that Guillaume could
not resist the temptation, but went off in its pursuit,
whilst I looked about for the nest. I found it to contain
fourteen eggs, which I carefully packed up so that
they should not break, and then rode off to meet Guillaume,
who, I was glad to see, had the ostrich already
dangling at his saddle. It turned out to be tolerably
fat, which, considering the season, was quite a miracle.
This piece of fortune put us into high spirits, and, as we
remarked to each other, our bad luck had evidently
abandoned us at last.</p>

<p>On we rode, gradually getting nearer to the hills,
which now loomed blackly against the sky; for the sun
had already sunk behind their sharp, irregular peaks,
and night was coming on apace. We passed several
large lakes, which proved to be salt; and gloomy and
dismal they looked, encircled by broad belts of shingle
and sand, with not a single bush or blade of grass in
their blighting vicinity. Leaving them behind us, we
stumbled on over the lava-covered ground, across a wild-looking
plain, strewn with jagged masses of rock, through
which our horses picked their way with extreme difficulty.
The ruggedness of the country increased as we
proceeded, and when we at last came to a break, where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
there was a small plain with plenty of grass and a pool
of fresh water, we resolved to go no further, but to
remain there for the night.</p>

<p>We brought our saddles and traps to a clump of stones,
which made a good shelter against the wind, and then
hobbled one of the horses, and secured the other with a
long cord to a heavy stone&mdash;a precaution not absolutely
necessary, as after a hard day's work they do not care
to stray far, but which we thought better to take on this
occasion, as we were in a broken country, where we
might have a great deal of difficulty in finding them
again, even if they only strayed a couple of hundred
yards. Having made our minds easy on this point, we
set about preparing supper, which, with the abundance
of material at our disposal, was an easy and a grateful
task. We were altogether in the very best of spirits that
evening, under the influence of our unwonted good cheer,
and at the thoughts of our speedy arrival at Sandy
Point and the indulgences we should then be able to
allow ourselves in such long-missed luxuries as coffee,
sugar, bread, tobacco, etc., of which and similar dainties
we talked till our mouths watered again. We reviewed
the events of the day, too, and recounted the various
impressions and feelings they had given rise to. It
was an open question who had passed the worst <i>quart
d'heure</i>&mdash;I whilst struggling in the water and feeling
that all was over, or Guillaume, when, after he had seen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
me disappear without returning, he reflected that he
must run the same risk, and possibly incur the same
fate. Meanwhile, having roasted and eaten as many
eggs as we dared, we sought our couches, and, overcome
by our day's exertions, soon fell into a sound sleep.</p>

<p>The words with which Guillaume woke me in the
morning brushed the sleepiness from my brain in an
instant, and made me jump to my feet and stare
blankly about me in utter dismay. 'The horses have
stampeded!' I said, repeating the sentence slowly after
him, dwelling on each word in complete stupefaction.
He nodded his head dejectedly, and sank down on his
couch, and for a long time neither of us spoke, each
giving way to his own gloomy train of thought.</p>

<p>It was, indeed, a stroke of misfortune, which, happening
as it did on the very night after we had overcome
what we believed to be the only obstacle which separated
us from Sandy Point, appeared almost in the
light of an intimation that we were fated never to
reach our destination.</p>

<p>The idea took such firm hold of my mind, and so
completely paralysed my energy, that for a short space
I allowed myself to give way to despair, and to a feeling
of incapacity to struggle any longer against what
in my agitation appeared to me a superior decree of
destiny. In truth, the difficulties which beset us were
no ordinary ones. We were about 150 miles from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
Sandy Point&mdash;no great distance to walk, it is true,
for a strong, healthy man, who can depend on a supply
of proper nourishment. But we were so weakened
that even such a slight exertion as saddling our horses
seemed often too much for our strength; the effort
required for crossing the river had been a spasmodic
burst, which we were quite incapable of sustaining for
any length of time. Besides, we were wholly unaccustomed
to walking, and long inaction had relaxed
those muscles we now most required. Even then,
however, it was not so much the actual distance which
frightened me as the nature of the ground to be gone
over. There were streams to be crossed, which at that
time of the year would be swollen and perhaps impassable
for us; marshy grounds to be traversed, which to
a man on horseback were nothing, but to cross which
on foot implied continual wettings; and we had only
four matches left, and therefore no means of making a
fire to dry ourselves by when once these were used.
Taking the uncongenial season into consideration, we
were not wrong in doubting whether our bodies would
stand all these hardships. With proper food, no doubt
they would; but there was another great difficulty.
When once we had consumed the ostriches' eggs and
the meat we had left, how were we to procure more?
We had a dog, it is true; but how could we follow him
on foot, when, in a few minutes, he could pursue a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
guanaco for ten miles, and run his prey to earth somewhere,
far beyond our ken? Besides, within a certain
distance from Sandy Point the guanacos cease altogether,
and ostriches are very scarce. The Indians,
Guillaume knew, were somewhere near the colony.
We might, therefore, meet them on the road, in which
case we should be all right; but, on the other hand,
they might have struck towards the Cordilleras, which
certainly would have been more in keeping with our
general luck. Whatever happened, one thing was
certain, and that was that we had a great deal of
misery and hardship to face, even supposing we should
have strength to overcome all difficulties and reach our
destination in safety.</p>

<p>All these considerations passed through my mind in
rapid succession, but having once looked the situation
steadily in the face and contemplated it in all its bearings,
my courage rose again, and I felt it was a great
deal too soon to despair. After all, there are very few
difficulties that are not to be vanquished by determination,
and, my momentary fit of despondency over, I
nerved myself to face whatever new trials might be in
store for us.</p>

<p>Guillaume now told me how he had risen at daybreak
and found the horses gone, the cord which had tied one
of them being broken. Amongst the confused tracks
he had seen footmarks of a puma, a circumstance which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
led him to suppose that this animal must have frightened
the horses during the night, and caused them to
stampede. He followed the tracks for a great distance,
and then lost them in a plain of scoriÃ¦, where it was, of
course, impossible to trace them any further. As a last
chance he had climbed several hills, and overlooked the
surrounding country, without, however, being able to
see the horses anywhere; and at last, completely exhausted,
he had returned to the camp. Having rapidly
reviewed our position, we resolved to commence our
pilgrimage immediately, as time was precious, in view
of the poor state of our larder. Not a moment was to
be lost&mdash;not on account of catching the steamer; that
was no longer uppermost in my mind&mdash;but we must
now hurry over as much ground as possible daily, to
save our lives.</p>

<p>I rolled two of my capas tightly together, and strapped
them on my shoulders like a knapsack. Guillaume took
a capa and a pair of saddle-bags, in one side of which
he put the six remaining eggs, and in the other all that
was left of the ostrich, which was not much after our
supper of last night, and what we had given to the dog,
for the bird, though fat, had unfortunately been small.
With as strict an economy as was compatible with keeping
up our strength, we had enough provisions to last us
for four days; after that&mdash;well, <i>quien sabe</i>; but I had
resolutely made up my mind not to think of the future,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
so all was right&mdash;for the present. We took our knives,
of course, and one tin cup; our revolvers, as being too
heavy, we left behind us, as well as our saddles, beds,
superfluous clothes, etc., etc., for the benefit of the foxes,
or whoever should chance to find them.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<p>We started off in tolerably good spirits, and it was well
we did so, for we had to draw upon them considerably
before the day was over. Our way lay over a short
plain, and across the range of hills above mentioned.
For the first two miles all went well, but after we had
climbed a couple of hills, I began to feel distressed. My
burden, which at the commencement had weighed
lightly enough, now began seriously to incommode me,
and I asked myself, if my strength was giving way
before the journey had hardly begun, how was I to
reach its end? Still, with closed teeth and bent brow,
I dragged myself wearily along, determined not to give
in. Guillaume was in no better plight than I. We had
long since abandoned any attempt at conversation&mdash;it
only used up our precious breath, and tired us the more.</p>

<p>At last we had to halt and rest a little, starting off
again after a few minutes' breathing-time, till we were
again obliged to stop to collect our strength; and in this
manner we went on all that afternoon, panting up steep
hills, and dragging ourselves along over plains which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
succeeded each other in weary monotony, and where
the boisterous winds, blowing full against us, obliged us
to double our exertions. At each fresh start we made I
had to put forth my whole strength to nerve myself for
the effort, and each time, I felt, would surely be the
last. Somehow or other, I kept on, however. It is
wonderful what one can do in the face of certain alternatives.
I soon suffered from another cause; my feet,
tender from long disuse, began to swell under these
sudden exertions. I was unable, after suffering for some
time, to keep my boots on, and had to continue the
march barefooted, over pebbles and short grasses which
were only slightly less merciless than the boots had
been.</p>

<p>At sunset we found ourselves descending into a valley,
where there was a small river. We had fortunately no
necessity to cross it, as our road lay along the valley
itself. In this region the bushes, which had gradually
been getting scarcer, ceased altogether. In the country
we were about to traverse, you may ride for leagues
and leagues without being able to find a piece of wood
big enough to make a toothpick with. The Indians,
when they pass through this region, always bring sufficient
firewood with them on their pack-horses to last
them during the transit. I can in no way account for
the absence in that particular region of the bushes
peculiar to the rest of the country, especially as the soil,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
the formation, and the atmospheric conditions seem to
be the same there as in the rest of Patagonia.</p>

<p>By the time we had gone a little way up the valley
we were all but completely exhausted; my legs felt like
lead, my breath came with difficulty, and I staggered
along as if about to fall at every step under my pack,
whose weight seemed to increase almost at every step.
It soon became necessary for us to halt altogether. We
threw off our burdens and stretched ourselves on the
grass, to enjoy the luxury of a good rest before troubling
ourselves about getting supper ready.</p>

<p>But this important task could not be long deferred,
especially as it was getting dark. We therefore began
to cast about for some substitute for firewood, of which,
as I have already mentioned, there was absolutely none
in that region. Guillaume consolingly remarked that
as soon as our four matches were exhausted, we should
have to eat our meat raw, and might as well, therefore,
begin to do so at once. I was not of his opinion, however,
feeling that the longer that unpleasant necessity
was deferred the better. The only suitable combustible we
were able to find was the dry dung of guanacos, of which
we managed to collect a good heap. We purposed to
ignite it with some dry grass, but as we only allowed ourselves
one match that day, I trembled for the result. Carefully
sheltering it from the wind, the match was at length
struck in safety and applied to the grass. It blazed up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
quick enough, but it had to be fed some time before
the dung could be coaxed into taking fire, or rather
smouldering, for the flame it emitted was almost imperceptible.
With the aid of the wind, the glow gradually
spread itself over the whole heap, and in it we managed
to roast our eggs and even to cook some meat. The
latter had a disagreeable flavour, even to our hardened
palates. As soon as we finished our supper, we lost no
time in getting under our capas, now our only bed, as
the fire held out but few enticements to linger over it
longer than was absolutely necessary for cooking purposes.</p>

<p>At daybreak the next morning we got up, and in the
heap of dung, which was fortunately still glowing, we
cooked some eggs, and prepared for starting. I wrapped
some pieces of cloth round my feet, to protect them from
hurt, and then we saddled ourselves and continued the
march. I felt very stiff, and altogether thoroughly done
up. In fact, I did not think I should be able to go on
for more than a couple of hours at most. Our path still
lay through the valley alongside the river, and we had
now come to the beaten track to Sandy Point, made in
the course of long years by the Indians on their annual
visit to that settlement.</p>

<p>Here we were pleasantly surprised by the sudden
apparition of a big dog, who frisked and jumped about
us in great glee, no doubt glad to have met with human
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
beings. He probably belonged to some Indian, and had
lost himself somehow in the pursuit of a guanaco, as
frequently happens.</p>

<p>This was the first gleam of sunshine after our late
bad luck, for the poor brute was very fat, and we foresaw
that its flesh would prove a godsend if we should
not happen to fall in with Indians. Our own dog was
not worth killing, being merely skin and bone. In view
of his probable fate, we called the new-comer 'Infeliz'&mdash;a
name to which he soon got to answer. He became
quite attached to me, little knowing why I paid him
such anxious attentions.</p>

<p>We went on pretty well for some time, of course,
with the usual halts every ten minutes. To-day, too, the
weather took it into its head to change; the sun became
unpleasantly warm, which, of course, increased our
fatigue considerably. At about twelve o'clock the path
broke off from the valley, and the country assumed a
threatening appearance, hill rising above hill for a long
distance. As we had walked more than six hours
already, we allowed ourselves a long rest before facing
the difficulties which now lay before us. We felt very
hungry, too; but, not daring to use a match, we were
obliged to eat some raw ostrich-meat. I thought it had
a peculiarly revolting taste, and more than ever I deprecated
the idea of perhaps having to undergo a regimen
of uncooked meat. I wondered, too, how Infeliz would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
taste raw, and felt that I certainly would not try him
unless pushed to the very last extremity.</p>

<p>When we felt somewhat restored, we arose, carefully
collected the fragments of our meal, and then continued
our wearisome journey. The path now lay across a succession
of hills, or undulations, which were very steep
and told fearfully upon us. We would rest a while on
the crest of each, and then go at the next one with a
rush, our teeth set and eyes bent on its summit; for if
we flinched once on our upward course, or halted but a
moment, we were done for, and had to take another
rest previous to collecting our strength for a new spurt.
Several times I thought I must give in, and at last I
could literally hardly move one leg before the other.
The perspiration rolled off my forehead in streams, and
the weight of my capas seemed to break my back. Still
we had set ourselves a certain goal, which was yet a
long way off; and though I was inwardly wishing that
Guillaume would give in, I was determined not to be
first to speak, but to go on as long as he did whilst
there was a step left in me. I believe he was in the
same plight as I was, but kept on for the same reasons.
At last a higher hill than usual fairly brought us to a
regular standstill, and we threw ourselves down, feeling
that, for that day at least, we could go no further.</p>

<p>We lay motionless for about half an hour, when I
rose to take off my pack, and in so doing perceived a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
column of smoke, not far, at least to all appearance,
from where we were. My shout of joyful surprise
brought Guillaume to his feet, and we both examined it
for some time, half doubting our own eyes, and fearful
lest every moment it should prove a delusion. Nor were
our feelings of pleasure wholly unmitigated by certain
apprehensions that it might be some old fire that had
been lit two or three days ago, and which was now
burning up again. Guillaume told me that he had
known fires to smoulder on in grassy glens for weeks
together. It might be but an hour old, and yet those
who had made it were, perhaps, already miles away in
some direction, far from the path we must follow; and
we could not signal our own whereabouts, as the
country we were then crossing was bare of grass and
bushes. Our doubts, however, were speedily set at rest.
Even as we watched the first column with eager eyes,
another rose up not far from it, and another still, and
then we knew that the fires were being made by Indians,
who were hunting on the plains. A little to the left of
the smoke was a place called the 'Campo de Batalla,'
where the Indians always camp when in that neighbourhood,
and to it we accordingly directed our steps,
as we were almost certain to find them there. The
vicinity of human beings gave us new strength. All
fatigue disappeared as if by magic; the hills, hitherto
so formidable, seemed to shrink into pigmy mounds;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
my pack became light as a feather, and the rags round
my feet seemed suddenly to possess the virtues of the
famed seven-mile boots. Not only should we be able
to get horses from the Indians, but, as they must
have recently left the settlement, they would have
plenty of tobacco, matÃ©, sugar, and biscuit, with the
thought of which I charmed away any relapse into
exhaustion, which, as hill followed hill in endless succession,
now and again threatened to overcome me. At
last, about four o'clock, we descended into a valley, a
sudden turn of which brought us in full view of the
Indian encampment. My heart bounded at the sight of
the tents, amongst which I could descry dark human
figures in long robes moving slowly to and fro; hundreds
of horses were grazing in the valley, whilst the
yelping of the swarms of curs that infest the Indian
camps fell on my ears like pleasant music.</p>

<p>The Indians were just returning from the chase, and
were pouring down from the plains on all sides. They
soon perceived us, and presently fifty or more horsemen
came flying towards us at full gallop. In another
moment we were surrounded by a chattering, laughing,
gesticulating crowd, who escorted us towards the camp
in triumph. One of their number, who could speak a
little Spanish, asked us a thousand questions, the
answers to which he translated for the benefit of the
others, to whom every item of information seemed to furnish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
an excuse for the most unbounded merriment; they
would all giggle and laugh, though what I had to say to
them did not contain anything extraordinarily funny, at
least as far as my perception of the humorous goes.</p>

<p>When we reached the camp, we were surrounded by
another crowd of Indians, as eagerly curious as the first
comers to know where we came from, what we had
done with our horses, and where we were going to&mdash;in
fact, all particulars as to our situation. As soon as
one group left, another arrived; and in this manner we
ran the gauntlet of the whole of the camp, everyone
apparently deeming it incumbent on him to come and
have a good stare and grin at us.</p>

<p>Having satisfied their curiosity, we felt ourselves at
liberty to consult our own comfort; and Guillaume
having discovered the whereabouts of the tent of a
cacique of the name of Orkeke, with whom he was
on intimate terms, we directed our steps towards it.
Orkeke himself, we found, had not as yet returned
from the chase; but his wife, an immensely fat and
good-humoured-looking old squaw, accosted us in some
friendly gutturals, of which the evident purport was
that we were to make ourselves at home&mdash;an intimation
on which we speedily acted. With a deep sigh of
relief, I divested myself of the pack under whose weight
I had trudged for so many a weary mile, and, stretching
myself out on the ground, I inwardly congratulated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
myself that the unpleasant episode of our foot-pilgrimage
was fortunately a thing of the past.</p>

<p>We had now, for the first time since we had seen the
smoke, leisure to muse over our providential delivery
from the serious danger that had threatened us&mdash;a
danger whose full magnitude only became apparent
now that we had no longer to fear it. But these
thoughts did not occupy us long; very soon Orkeke
arrived, heavily laden with the spoils of the chase. He
seemed very pleased to see us, and greeted us affably
in broken Spanish. To the story of our mishaps he
listened with great interest, and when I told him that
I had not taken matÃ© or smoked for several weeks, he
showed particular concern, and immediately produced
a pipe and tobacco, and bade me smoke, at the same
time telling his wife to prepare matÃ©, remarking very
justly, 'No fumar, no tomar matÃ©; muy malo!'
Smokers will feel with me when I say that my hand
trembled whilst filling my pipe, and that, having lit it,
I sat for a few minutes in a state of semi-ecstasy,
enveloped in a fragrant cloud of the long-missed
soul-soother. The matÃ©, too, seemed delicious; and
as a great treat, from a bag which contained similar
treasures, Orkeke brought forth a musty biscuit, which
he broke into three pieces, solemnly handing a share to
Guillaume and me. The biscuit was coarse and black
and hard, no doubt, but it melted away on my lips like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
a <i>meringue</i>, nor did I allow one crumb of it to be
lost.</p>

<p>Orkeke was an admirable specimen of the Tehuelche
race. He was tall and well proportioned, and, notwithstanding
his great age, extremely vigorous and agile.
His long grey hair and the benign expression of his face
gave him the look of a venerable patriarch&mdash;a character
which he rather affected to maintain. He was careful
to inform me, at an early stage of our acquaintance, that
he never got drunk, like the other Indians; that he
never told a lie; and that his father had been converted
to Christianity&mdash;a circumstance which he evidently
considered to reflect in some way meritoriously on himself.
On my asking him why he had not followed his
father's example and become a Christian too, after a
long pause he answered rather vaguely, "Quien sabe."
I did not press the question any further, as the Indians
who speak Spanish always make use of this expression
when puzzled, or when they do not care to give a direct
reply, and if once they proffer it as an answer, it is perfectly
useless to attempt to elicit anything more explicit
from them.</p>

<p>Orkeke told me that he remembered perfectly well
having paid a visit to St. Julian, as a boy, when the
Spanish colonists of Viedma were yet there. If that
were true&mdash;and I have no reason to doubt his word&mdash;his
age was now at least ninety-six or ninety-seven, and,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
judging by his looks, I thought he might easily live
twenty or thirty years longer. His movements were as
easy and as free from effort as those of a young man.
Indeed, I should imagine few climates are healthier or
more favourable to longevity than that of Patagonia;
its crisp, dry air has a peculiarly beneficent effect both
on mind and body, and under its influence one experiences
a buoyancy of spirits, and a general well-being,
which are quite astonishing.</p>

<p>Orkeke spoke Spanish with tolerable fluency, and I
was able to have a long conversation with him on various
topics, during which I gleaned some interesting information
about the customs and thoughts of the Indians.</p>

<p>The tribe I was now amongst was more numerous
than that of the Northern Tehuelches, but it seemed to
me that they were, on the average, slightly inferior in
physique to the Northerners, and certainly there were
not so many pretty squaws among them as among the
latter. Otherwise there was no marked distinction
between them. The camp consisted of twelve tents,
containing in all from four to five hundred souls.
The whole tribe, I found, had just been paying their
annual visit to Sandy Point, to receive the rations of
sugar, biscuit, matÃ©, and tobacco, which the Chilian
Government accords them. These visits generally cost
them rather dear, as the inhabitants of the colony, on
these occasions, make a rich harvest of furs and feathers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
with which, under the influence of aguadiente, the
Indians are then extremely prodigal.</p>

<p>I made Orkeke promise to get me two horses the next
morning, in order that we might immediately continue
our journey, and having eaten a hearty supper, I went
to sleep on a couch of furs, which Mrs. Orkeke had prepared
for me, and, notwithstanding the incessant squalling
of babies in various parts of the tent, I managed to
pass a tolerable night.</p>

<p>The next morning, as soon as Orkeke had risen, I
asked him to get the horses in readiness, as I was leaving
at once. But there was an unpleasant surprise in store
for me. Orkeke seemed to have no remembrance of
what he had promised the previous evening, and coolly
told me that he could not lend me any of his horses, as,
according to him, they were all 'thin and tired,' 'Mi
caballo, muy flaco, muy cansado,' was all I could get
out of him in reply to my indignant demands for an explanation
of the unaccountable change in his intentions.
In vain I argued, entreated, and stormed; in vain I
offered to pay him double the sum we had previously agreed
on&mdash;nothing would move him, and finally I gave
up pressing the matter, directing my energies instead to
discovering some more accommodating Indian.</p>

<p>My task was not an easy one, and I soon found out
that to drive a bargain with an Indian one must have
the patience of Job and the temper of an angel. It is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
next to an impossibility to get a plain 'yes' or 'no' out
of them, as they have an insuperable aversion to committing
themselves finally, either one way or the other.
The consequence is that one may haggle with them for
hours, without arriving at any result, and without even
being able to judge whether one is likely to arrive at
any, so vague and circumlocutory are their answers.
Unfortunately, too, I was obliged to employ an interpreter,
thus reducing still further the chances of my
coming to any definite understanding.</p>

<p>After having interviewed some forty Indians, who all,
after more or less vacillation and delay, proffered the
stereotyped objection, 'Mi caballo, muy flaco,' I began to
despair of succeeding at all, and as a last resource, went
back to Orkeke, who, I hoped, might possibly again
have changed his mind and become less obdurate. But
the obstinate old cacique was inexorable, and calmly
recommended me to wait patiently for a few days, as
very soon some traders would be coming from the
colony. He could not understand that anyone could
possibly be in a hurry. Indians never are; and I have
no doubt that the fact of my being in such a desperate
haste to get away awoke some suspicions in his mind as
to my motives, and inclined him to persist in his refusal
to accommodate me. I was at my wits' end. Nothing
could be further from my intentions than to wait with
the Indians till some trader should come to the camp.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
The very thought made me furious. I had not risked
crossing Gallegos for that, and yet I must either remain
or start off on foot, neither of which prospects I contemplated
with much satisfaction.</p>

<p>Though my own attempts had failed, I thought that
perhaps Orkeke might be able to negotiate more successfully
for the hire of two horses from some one amongst
his acquaintances; and as an inducement for him to
exert himself in my behalf, I offered to give him a guanaco
mantle. My proposal set him thinking, and presently
he said: 'I know Indian&mdash;very rich man&mdash;three
hundred horses&mdash;quien sabe, he lend you two.' Of
course, I jumped at the suggestion, and proposed that
we should immediately go and see this great and good
man, the owner of three hundred horses. But Orkeke
met my impetuosity with a tantalising 'Mas tarde,' and
I had to restrain my impatience for more than an hour,
during the course of which I relieved my feelings with
many a bitter imprecation at Tehuelche supineness. At
last Orkeke seemed to have nerved himself for the tremendous
effort, and signified to me that he was ready to
accompany me to the tent of the rich man. I approached
this awful being, whom I found reclining at ease on his
furs, with feelings of the deepest respect, for did he not
hold the means of relieving me from the serious and
aggravating plight which fate and the obstinacy of his
brethren had brought me into?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span></p>

<p>Orkeke conversed with him for some time&mdash;very
leisurely and unconcernedly, I thought, considering the
gravity of the issue of the negotiations&mdash;and then, turning
to me, he asked me to tell his friend, who understood
Spanish, what I wanted.</p>

<p>I began. 'You have plenty horses?'</p>

<p>'Yes, plenty.'</p>

<p>'Quien sabe, you lend me two?'</p>

<p>Here a long pause, during which I anxiously endeavoured
to read the answer to my question in the face of
the Indian. But its expression was a blank. Presently
he suggested:</p>

<p>'How much you pay?'</p>

<p>'Oh, plenty sugar, plenty biscuit, plenty silver dollar,'
I exclaimed, gesticulating to an unlimited extent, and
radiant with satisfaction, as now I thought the matter
had taken a practical and final turn.</p>

<p>'Bueno! But how send back horses to Indian?'</p>

<p>'Guillaume come back with horses and presents from
colony in six days.'</p>

<p>Here another long pause. The Indian seemed to be
looking at some object on the hills fifty miles away,
apparently oblivious of my presence. As he did not
offer to resume the conversation, after a while I suggested
cheerfully:</p>

<p>'Very well, all is settled; you go and fetch the
horses, whilst I prepare my things and get ready to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
leave.' To my surprise he did not respond to my suggestion
as readily as I had expected. I presumed I was
going too quickly for him, and accordingly I modified
my proposal this wise: 'Quien sabe, when will you fetch
horses for me?'</p>

<p>No answer: the object on the hills still claimed his
undivided attention. I waited patiently, wonderfully
patiently, for a reply; though now and then, in the
course of the quarter of an hour's silence which ensued,
I did feel that it would have been an unspeakable relief
to have given my <i>nonchalant</i> friend just one little cut
with my whip. We cannot all have the dispositions of
saints.</p>

<p>I contented myself, after the lapse of time mentioned,
with repeating, 'Quien sabe, when will you fetch horses
for me?'</p>

<p>Then fell on my ears 'some words, which were
warning of doom!'&mdash;'Mi caballo, muy flaco, muy cansado.'</p>

<p>After having had my hopes raised to the highest
point of expectation, to see them thus suddenly dashed
to the ground for some mere whim, and without a show
of reason, was more than flesh and blood could stand; I
regret to say that I lost my temper, and hurled at the
passive Indian a shower of furious imprecations. I am
bound to say, however, that they did not seem to have
the slightest effect upon him, and merely provoked a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
chorus of mocking laughter from the squaws. I went
away in high dudgeon, and my reflections, after I had
cooled down a little, were not rendered any pleasanter
by the confession I had to make to myself, that I had
no business to lose my temper, as, after all, the Indian
had a perfect right to do as he chose with his own.
Still, it was rather exasperating that, much as I wanted
them, with two thousand horses grazing in the ravine
around me, I could not obtain two.</p>

<p>Fortunately, relief was near at hand. I was just discussing
with Guillaume what was to be done next, when
Orkeke came up to us, and said that a scout had just
arrived, and had told him that a white man was camping
at a lake some eighteen miles away, and that, for a consideration,
he would lend us a couple of horses to take
us so far.</p>

<p>In half an hour the horses were driven up; and
having made some small presents to Mrs. Orkeke and
her family, I hastily left, fearing lest, acting on some
new caprice, Orkeke might, at the last moment, find
some pretext for taking the horses away from us
again.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<p>At last we said good-bye to the Indians, and set out,
accompanied by a man who was to take the horses back,
<i>en route</i> for a lake called the 'Laguna del Finado
Romero,' after an ill-fated white man, who, like ourselves,
had lost his horses in the pampa, and, unluckier
than we had been, had failed to fall in with anyone on
the road, and had finally died of starvation near the lake
that now bears his name.</p>

<p>Our horses were lean, overworked, and broken-winded,
and we were obliged to ride bare-backed, as the Indians
had refused to lend us saddles; but we cared little for
such slight drawbacks, in the joy of once more being
able to look forward with certainty to a speedy arrival
at our destination.</p>

<p>We had only been on foot for three days, but, looking
back, it seemed to me an age since I had last bestrode
a horse; and the pleasure I experienced, as we broke
into a tolerably swift gallop, was heightened by the remembrance
of those unpleasant days during which we
trudged wearily along on foot, esteeming it a great triumph
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
if we successfully scaled some pigmy hill without
having to lie down two or three times to take breath,
and when we hardly dared look at the vast expanse of
plain before us, lest we should lose courage at the sight.
Contrasted with that period of our journey, our present
situation was all <i>couleur de rose</i>. Our sorry nags seemed
gifted with the fleetness of the wind, their distressed
puffing sounded in our ears like the proud snorting of
the fiery steed scenting the chase, and their irregular
pace, half gallop, half stumble, seemed as soft and pleasant
as the gentle amble of a pampered park hack.</p>

<p>After about three hours' sharp riding, we reached the
lake, beside which was pitched the tent of the white
man of whom the Indians had told us. The barking of
the dogs warned him of our approach, and he came out
to meet us, not a little astonished at our appearance, as
the Indians had told him that the Gallegos had risen,
and, of course, he had not imagined that anyone could
have come from Santa Cruz. He kindly welcomed
us into his tent, where the first thing that struck my
eye, as smacking pleasantly of civilisation, was an
empty preserved-milk-tin. Our new host, whose name
was Emilio, was an old acquaintance of Guillaume's, and
he very kindly offered to lend us horses to continue our
journey to Sandy Point with, as the Indian was returning
with those we had come on.</p>

<p>As the weather looked very threatening, and big rain-drops
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
were already beginning to fall, we thought it best
to defer our start for another day, feeling that, in one
way and another, we had had quite enough wettings
lately.</p>

<p>The tent we now found ourselves in seemed 'fitted
up' with all modern conveniences; indeed, Emilio appeared
to be, as he in reality was, rather an amateur
than a professional ostrich-hunter, and his neat riding-suit
and general clean appearance made me, for the
first time, painfully conscious of the strange scarecrow
figure I must have made in the eyes of a civilised
human being. The pampa had dealt rather roughly with
my wardrobe. I was hatless, shoeless, and coatless,
having tossed away or lost all these necessary articles
of wear at various periods of my peregrinations. My
shirt and trousers were tattered and torn; my hair,
which had been a stranger to the comb for weeks, was
long and matted; and my face, from continual exposure
to sun and wind, had become of a deep Tehuelche brown.
Fortunately, no excuses for my appearance were necessary;
and, having dismissed our Indian friend with his
horses, we sat down in the tent to discuss some matÃ©
and a pipe, over which luxuries Emilio satisfied my
voracious appetite for news of the war in the East, with
such items of information as he had picked up lately
in Sandy Point.</p>

<p>Touching the dinner-hour, which was now approaching,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
he told us that his companion had gone to the
settlement ten days ago to fetch provisions, and as he
had not yet come back, he (Emilio) had run short of
everything, and had not so much as a biscuit in the
place&mdash;a piece of information which gave me a shock,
which I trust I bore with more outward composure than
my inner feelings warranted. However, when dinner
was served, matters turned out to be better than Emilio
had represented, and our hearts were gladdened over a
puchero of guanaco meat, seasoned with onions, pepper,
and salt, and other old acquaintances, whose want we
had lately so often and so feelingly deplored.</p>

<p>Darkness came on soon after dinner was over, and we
were accordingly not long in turning in. All through
the night there was a heavy downpour of rain, and as I
listened to it pattering on the canvas of our tent, snugly
rolled up in my warm capa, I thought, with a shudder,
in what a different plight I should have then been had
we not had the good fortune to meet the Indians. Instead
of lying warm and dry under the shelter of the
tent, we should doubtless have been stretched somewhere
on the muddy ground, in damp clothes and soaking
furs, hungry and sleepless, and exposed to the
inclemency of the weather, without even the means of
making a fire.</p>

<p>The next day the rain cleared off at about ten o'clock,
and Emilio, who was anxious to know what had become
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
of his companion, resolved to accompany us, leaving his
tent and horses in charge of a servant. On the previous
day I had felt little inconvenience from riding barebacked,
the satisfaction of having a horse at all far
outweighing the consideration of any minor discomforts.
But to-day I could no longer remain callous to the inconvenience
and pain of bumping up and down hour
after hour on the back of a not over well-conditioned
horse. After the first few miles, the sensation experienced
became extremely unpleasant, and gradually
developed into a species of mild torture&mdash;to culminate,
after galloping some thirty miles, in the most excruciating
anguish the mind can conceive of. However, we
were not to be stopped by mere pain, and jogged along
as best we could.</p>

<p>The country we now traversed began to differ essentially
from the regions I had hitherto passed through.
The monotonous alternation of plains and ravines gave
way to a not less monotonous succession of soft swells
or undulations. The height of the crests of these undulations
was about twenty feet, and the soil which
covered them, judging from the appearance of the grass,
seemed of a more fertile nature than that of the country
farther north. As yet, however, there was no appearance
of any new species of bush. Occasionally an
ostrich would start up at our approach; but already we
began to miss the familiar sight of the guanacos, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
are, until one arrives as far south as we now were, an
inevitable feature of a Patagonian landscape.</p>

<p>After emerging from this undulating tract, the transit
of which occupied several hours, we came into an
irregularly-formed country, abounding in fresh-water
lakes, which were covered with wild geese and ducks.
Here the calafatÃ© bushes seemed to grow stronger and
healthier-looking; and the now green grass, growing in
abundance everywhere, gave an unaccustomed look of
fertility to the country. We were not far from Cape
San Gregorio, and occasionally we could catch a hazy
glimpse of the sea.</p>

<p>Meantime evening came on, and we began to look
about for a favourable place to camp at for the night.
In casting about we observed a thin column of smoke
arising from a small gorge some little way ahead.
Thither we accordingly rode, and presently came upon
a young fellow who was just making a fire, he having
evidently arrived a few minutes ago. His horses were
grazing about the caÃ±on. He started up at our approach,
and greeted us very cordially, Guillaume being
an old acquaintance of his. He turned out to be a
Frenchman, and had formerly been cook to the Governor
of Sandy Point, but had subsequently taken to ostrich-hunting
and trading with the Indians as more congenial
pursuits.</p>

<p>He was a very pleasant and lively companion, and we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
had a very cheerful evening together. Besides, at dinner
he gave us some specimens of his art, which stamped him
as a master, or at least I thought so then. I actually
found a laurel-leaf in the puchero of this epicurean
ostrich-hunter, and presently he turned out an <i>omelette
aux fines herbes</i>, which might have been prepared in a
royal kitchen, instead of in the desert, over a smoky,
green-wood fire, by the doubtful light of a few stars. As
he kindly offered to lend us horses to go on with, there
was no necessity for Emilio to accompany us any
further, especially as, through our new acquaintance, he
had got news of the coming of his absent companion.
Before we went to bed, therefore, I thanked him for his
kindness, and said good-bye to him, as Guillaume and
I intended starting at about three o'clock in the morning,
in order to get to Sandy Point the same night. We
purposed starting thus early as there was an arm of the
sea to cross, which, if we happened to reach it at high-water,
might detain us for several hours. I also took
leave of our host, and then we all went to our beds, to
sleep through what I hoped was to be my last night on
the pampa.</p>

<p>When the position of the stars seemed to indicate its
being about three o'clock, Guillaume and I, after a hasty
cup of coffee, bridled the horses that had been lent to
us, and waving a silent adieu to our sleeping companions,
we rode off through the darkness towards the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
Cabeza del Mar, or 'Head of the Sea,' which we hoped
to reach at low-water. We were not so well mounted
as the day before, as we soon discovered to our cost.
My horse, in particular, was a lean, raw-boned animal,
with a terribly rough gallop, and as the trail had now
become swampy and full of holes, it would occasionally
stumble and throw me forward in a most punishing
manner, and I suffered even more than the day before
from the want of a saddle. Meanwhile, the darkness
slowly gave way to dawn, and by the time the sun had
risen, we reined in our panting horses, on whom the
steep hills and heavy ground had told severely, at the
rocky shores of the Cabeza del Mar. The water was at
ebb-tide, and we had to wait an hour or two before we
could cross over. Cabeza del Mar, marked on the
Admiralty charts as Peckett's Harbour, is an inlet of the
sea which runs for some distance into the interior.</p>

<p>Having crossed over without any accident, we again
continued our journey at a gallop. The ground was
very soft, and for miles was half under water. At one
spot my horse sank into a quagmire, and it was only with
the greatest difficulty that I finally got it out again.
Altogether, our horses, which were very thin and in
wretched condition, began to show signs of distress as
the hours wore on, and at times we were apprehensive
lest they would not be able to reach Sandy Point. Still
we splashed on through mire and water, without sparing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
whip or spur. Now and then we caught sight of the
sea, and when the rising wind swept away the mist
which obscured the horizon, the snow-clad peaks of the
distant Cordilleras showed plainly against the blue sky.
We hailed them with delight, for we knew that at the
foot of the last spur lay Sandy Point.</p>

<p>Presently we passed a stunted clump of beeches,
standing in the midst of the bare plain, like an advanced
picket of the dense forests which, a little farther
south, clothe the sides of the straits and the broad
slopes of the Cordilleras. After having passed so many
weeks without having seen any vegetation but the
grass and low scrub of the pampas, the sight of these
beeches was indescribably refreshing and cheering, and
produced the same exhilarating effect on us as the
sudden appearance of land after a long sea-voyage
does on the traveller, weary of the eternal sameness of
sea and sky.</p>

<p>On we went, leaving the beeches behind us, over a
broad grass-covered plain, now half under water and a
mere swamp, the distant hills growing gradually more
and more distinct. By this time I had grown as tired
as my horse, and had left off the use of either whip or
spur, as it seemed to take no notice of them, just jogging
along at its own pace, a kind of slinging shuffle, varied
now and then by a lurch forward, as if about to fall&mdash;an
ending to our ride which would not have surprised
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
me in the least, considering the condition of the poor
animal and the distance we had gone since morning.
But the Patagonian horses are wonderfully hardy, and
can do an astonishing amount of work in a condition
which makes it seem doubtful whether they will be able
to carry their own weight. This was the case with those
we were now riding, which were mere skin and bone;
and yet we had been already nine hours on the road,
scaling steep hills, and staggering over swampy, heavy
ground of the most trying nature.</p>

<p>Time went on. The beeches became more frequent,
and finally we arrived at the foot of a thickly wooded
hill, which seemed to mark the commencement of a
totally new region; for whereas hitherto all vegetation
had been scarce and stunted, it now became comparatively
varied and luxuriant. Following a beaten track,
we rode up the hill through a glade of beeches, which
were just bursting into leaf. On reaching its summit I
paused, for suddenly flashed on my gaze, lying at the
foot of the hill on whose crest I now stood, the shining
waters of the Straits of Magellan. With avidity I
feasted my eyes, wearied of the eternal monotony of the
pampa horizon, on the varied and sunlit scene before me.
In strange contrast to the bare plains I had just left was
the bold outline of the winding coast, which sank
abruptly down, green with dense foliage, to the very
edge of the foaming water, whilst in the background
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
rose the gigantic ridges of the Cordilleras, their sharply-cut
and snow-clad peaks standing plainly defined on the
for once cloudless sky.</p>

<p>On the opposite side of the straits the tall cliffs of
Terra del Fuego were plainly visible; and presently,
emerging from a bend in the coast, a little schooner
came skimming down, with all her sails set and her
colours flying, bound, no doubt, for the neighbouring
Falkland Islands.</p>

<p>But time was precious, as we wanted to get to Sandy
Point before night-time; so off we started again, down
the precipitous side of the hill, the bottom of which we
reached after many a slip and stumble, the melting of
the snows having carried away whole lengths of what
had been a beaten pathway. The farmhouse of Cabo
Negro now came in sight, and near it, grazing at their
ease in the fresh young grass, were herds of horses and
cattle. As their familiar lowing fell on my ears, my
heart quite warmed towards the sleek-coated, gentle-eyed
cows, and I bestowed a kindly greeting on them in
passing, quite as if they had been human beings. But
to me at that moment they represented something more
than mere milk and butter in perspective (though that
consideration was not altogether absent from my mind).
In their staid, respectable demeanour, so different from
the wild capers and antics of my late friends, the
guanacos, I recognised the softening influences of civilisation,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
and in my present mood I was only too glad to
be able to hail its presence under any symbol, even though
it were but in the lowly guise of a simple-minded cow.</p>

<p>On reaching the farmhouse we dismounted for a
while, in order to give our horses the rest they sorely
needed. The owner, Lieutenant Gallegos, received us
very kindly, and asked us into the house to take some
refreshment. Whilst the meal was being prepared, I
explained to him the circumstances which had brought
us into the strange plight in which he beheld us, our
saddleless nags and our dilapidated appearance having
naturally aroused his curiosity. He was not surprised
to hear of the unusually high flood at Gallegos, as, on
the melting of the snows, there had been great inundations
all round the colony, and an unprecedented snowfall
during the winter. The winter itself had been of
unusual duration, for although it was now almost
summer-time, until a few days since, like ourselves,
they had experienced regular wintry weather. In the
meantime a repast had been served, and I sat down
actually on a chair, and ate off a plate with knife and
fork, feeling quite awkward and bearish, as if I had till
then never enjoyed such luxuries. However, this feeling
soon wore off, and before I had finished my meal I
felt quite at home again. As soon as we had exhausted
our respective budgets of news, we said good-bye to
Lieutenant Gallegos, and remounted our horses, who had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
profited by the short respite allowed them, and had
become tolerably fresh again.</p>

<p>Our path now lay along the Straits of Magellan.
The water almost washed our horses' feet as we rode
along the narrow path, for the mainland falls almost
vertically down to the waters edge, and is covered with
a dense, impenetrable mass of trees and bushes&mdash;the
latter chiefly of the magnolia species&mdash;and one is forced
to keep on the meagre strip of stony beach, which in
some places is hardly three feet broad. This narrow
track was further occasionally obstructed by trunks of
beech-trees and other drift-wood, torn probably from
the land on the opposite side, and swept thither by the
sea in its angry moods; and sometimes a still more
formidable hindrance would present itself, in the shape
of a landslip, with a whole slice of virgin forest torn
away with it, the trees, bushes, and creepers still green
and flourishing. In those cases, where the soil had
already been washed away by the sea, all the less
durable vegetation having long mouldered away, a prey
to the wind and waves, only the dead trees remained,
looking sad and ghastly in their untombed nakedness&mdash;some
fallen, others still upright, but leaning against
each other in forlorn helplessness, their white, bare
roots firmly interlaced, and their long, dry arms rattling
against each other in the wind, like the bones of
so many skeletons.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span></p>

<p>Following its numerous bends, we rode along the
beach for about three hours: and then, in measure as
we approached the long sandy strip of land which
stretches out into the sea, and which has given the
name of Sandy Point to the settlement, the beach got
broader, the fall of the land less abrupt, and the forest
gradually lightened, till, reaching the Government sawmill,
which is situated at about six miles from the
colony, we came to an open plain, studded here and
there with beeches, across which we galloped for some
time; and finally, having forded one or two small
streams, we at last arrived in sight of the town itself.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

<p>The colony of Magellan was founded by the Chilian
Government in the year 1851. The population of
Sandy Point, including the convicts and garrison, and
the Swiss settlers of Agua Fresca, numbered, at the
time I am speaking of, about eight hundred souls.
The town lies at the foot of a high ridge of hills,
facing the straits. It contained a fort, a church, and
some tolerable-looking Government buildings, but,
excepting one or two streets in the lower part of the
town, the rest of the place had a poor, straggling
appearance, the houses being mostly one-storied wooden
shanties, and the streets grass-grown and hillocky, with
here and there the stump of a beech-tree sticking up
from the ground. But to me, as I rode through it, just
before sundown, tired and fagged with my day's ride,
it looked pleasant and cheerful enough, for it held out
promises of shelter, rest, and good cheer, after a long,
weary time of exposure and hardship, and it was,
besides, a connecting link with the outer world, to
reach which had been my only thought for weeks&mdash;weeks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
which, as I looked back on them, in the variety
of sensation and incident which had marked their
course, seemed almost so many years.</p>

<p>I rode slowly up the main street, letting my eyes
wander leisurely over the unaccustomed sights which
everywhere met my gaze, and which I greeted inwardly
one by one, as it were renewing an old acquaintance.
The shops with their many wares displayed in the
windows, the knots of drinkers standing at the bars,
which in Sandy Point grace every establishment, be it
a butcher's, or a baker's, or a tailor's; the little children
playing about the streets; the housewives taking in
their little washing from the clothes-line, and doing a
great deal of gossip over it, as is their wont; the cows
coming lowing down from the woods with their calves,
and going to their respective homes to be milked; the
loungers in collars and neckties (strange sight), who
stared at me as I went past&mdash;everything and everybody
came in for a share of my attention. Each one sight
helped to confirm the complacent feeling of security
from further danger which had come over me since I
passed the Cabo Negro farm-house. The turn in the
long lane had come at last, the chapter of accidents was
over, and, like the heroes of the fairy tales, I was to
live happy ever after. Alas for human foresight!
Could I have foreseen the events which in a few hours
were to take place, in all probability I should then and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
there have turned my horse round and ridden with all
speed back to the pampas. But if coming events do
cast their shadows before them, it is very seldom that
our imperfect mental vision can perceive them, and certainly
there was no forecast of the horrors of the coming
day in the atmosphere of the settlement of Sandy Point,
on the evening of that 10th of November. People came
and went, and laughed and talked with each other, just
as usual, little thinking that by that time to-morrow
they would be flying from their pillaged and burning
homes, with their wives and children, and that the
colony, now so tranquil and peaceful, would to-morrow
be delivered into the hands of a set of sanguinary ruffians,
free to indulge in their worst passions unchecked.</p>

<p>There are no inns at Sandy Point, visitors being of
rare occurrence, so we put up at the house of an
Austrian, named Pedro, who had formerly been an
Indian trader, and now kept a small shop. After
having indulged in the luxury of a warm bath and a
shave, and having made some suitable changes in my
raiment, I sat down to dine with Pedro. The havoc I
made amongst cheeses, fresh butter, bread, jam, etc., was
tremendous. I think&mdash;and it is an important consideration
which, strange to say, has escaped even Brillat-Savarin&mdash;that
every man who has any pretension to
considering himself a gastronome, should make it a
supreme duty to give his palate a complete rest, at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
least once a year, and subsist for a month or two on as
poor a diet as is compatible with keeping body and soul
together. His temporary self-denial will be more than
repaid by the renewed sensibility of his palate which
will result from such a course, and he will return to his
favourite dishes with that fresh zest and exquisite enjoyment
which is vouchsafed to most people only in the
palmy heyday of their schoolboy appetites.</p>

<p>After dinner I lost no time in going to bed. I had
been fifteen hours, not in the saddle, but literally on
horseback, and I was weary enough, as may be supposed.
I felt, as I lay down on my bed, that I had well
earned a good night's rest, and was but little prepared
for the rude awakening in store for me.</p>

<p>Towards midnight I was aroused by a noise which at
first I took for thunder, but which on repetition, to my
astonishment, proved to be the report of cannon. While
I was still listening and wondering what could be the
matter, Guillaume came hurriedly into the room and
cried: 'The convicts and the soldiers have mutinied,
and are firing on the lower town.' I was too sleepy to
be able to quite seize the situation, and this startling
piece of news only elicited a growl from me to the effect
that I thought they might have waited till the morning,
and I fell back, and was just dozing off again, when a
volley of musketry, discharged at that moment close to
our door, followed by a loud shriek, thoroughly awoke
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
me, and I jumped out of bed and hurriedly put on my
clothes.</p>

<p>As soon as all was quiet outside the house, I went to
the door and cautiously opened it. It was still dark,
but daybreak, to all appearance, was not far off. The
streets near Pedro's house were quite deserted, but in
the direction of the plaza there was a great commotion,
and the shouting of many voices, the rattling of horses'
hoofs over the paved streets, the deep growl of cannon,
or the sharp report of a Remington, broke ominously on
the silence of the night. Curious to know what was
going on, Guillaume and I slipped into the street and
stole towards the plaza, in order to question any person
we might happen to meet as to the exact nature of the
disturbance. Presently, in running along, I stumbled
over something, and on turning back to look I found,
with a shudder, that it was the dead body of a man,
probably the one whose shriek we heard a short time
ago. We had not gone far, when we saw somebody
hastening our way as fast as his legs could carry him.
We detained him for a moment, though he was as
impatient to be gone as the wedding guest in the ballad,
and he told us that the convicts and soldiers had
mutinied, and had killed the governor of the colony, the
captain of the garrison, and all the officers, and were
now engaged in fighting among themselves. With this
information we went back to the house, wondering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
what the upshot of the whole affair would be&mdash;a matter
which it was rather difficult to foretell, as the Chilian
man-of-war generally stationed at Sandy Point was at
that time surveying the straits some distance away, and
till she arrived the convicts and soldiers would be
masters of the situation.</p>

<p>Our evil star, as I remarked to Guillaume, was still
in the ascendant; indeed, it was a most peculiar instance
of a continued run of bad luck, that <i>on the very night</i> of
our safe arrival amongst civilised people, after having
overcome not a few obstacles which had risen one after
the other to frustrate our plans, an event should occur
whose ultimate consequences might cause us to regret
that we had ever crossed the Gallegos. Besides, it was
not as if it were one of the ordinary accidents that may
reasonably happen at any moment; far from it, the
event in question was of so unusual a nature as to fairly
make it improbable that it could happen even once in
half a century. This being the case, it was rather provoking
that, given all the antecedents of my journey, it
should just happen at the very moment of my passing
through Sandy Point.</p>

<p>There were as yet, however, no grounds for apprehending
anything serious. It was probable that the
mutineers, having obtained their liberty, would make
use of it to escape as quickly as possible to the pampas,
though what they were to do when they got there was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
best known to themselves. With these and sundry
other unpleasant reflections passing through my mind,
I lay down on my couch, and went to sleep again.
When I awoke it was broad daylight. On opening my
eyes I was startled by the sight of a drunken convict,
who was leaning against the door of my room, holding a
box of sardines in one hand and a piece of bread in the
other. His Remington rifle, which, judging by the smell
of powder it emitted, had been discharged several times,
lay on the table beside my bed. He glared stupidly at
me as I got up and went past him into the shop, which
I found full of convicts and soldiers, who were eating
and drinking and squabbling, and brandishing their
Remingtons about in such a clumsy way that I expected
at any moment to see some accident happen. They
told me that they had killed the governor and all his
family, and that they were now going off to the pampa
to escape to the Argentine Republic. They professed to
have no intention of harming any of the colonists, all
they required being that they should be allowed to take
whatever they wanted free of payment. They were
continually quarrelling among themselves, the chief
object of their dispute being the honour, to which every
one seemed to lay claim, of having killed the governor&mdash;the
truth being that he had not been killed by anyone,
having escaped on horseback shortly after the revolt
broke out. When one crowd left, another would come
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
in, and so on all the morning, till very soon all the
drinkables and eatables in Pedro's shop had disappeared.</p>

<p>Most of the mutineers, both soldiers and convicts,
were Chilotes, as the people of the island of Chiloe are
called. To do them justice, I must say that I have
never seen a more repulsively ugly and wretched-looking
race than these same Chilotes, at least, if I am to judge
of them by the numerous specimens I had the pleasure
of seeing at Sandy Point. They are of low stature and
light build, their complexion is swarthy, their foreheads
low, and the general expression of their faces is one
of brutish stupidity blended with savage ferocity. I
think there is, on the whole, very little to choose between
them and the Fuegians, who, I believe, are commonly
admitted to represent the lowest type of humanity
extant.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the day wore on, but the mutineers did
not seem in any hurry to quit the colony. It was impossible
to leave the house to obtain any news of the
revolt, as they were amusing themselves by firing
random shots in all directions, during which pastime
not a few of their own number were accidentally killed.
About this time they commenced a wholesale pillage of
the shops, at which task they were assisted by the
women and the Chilian colonists generally. I do not
think the latter actually took part in any of the acts of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
violence subsequently committed, but at the commencement
of the revolt they certainly fraternised with the
mutineers, and, in company with the latter, plundered
and drank freely. Some colonists who lived opposite
Pedro's house were busy all day long in carrying loads
of wearing apparel and goods of all descriptions from
the various shops into their dwellings. What they were
ultimately to do with all their spoils, I suppose they
hardly knew themselves, though, if they had not been
too drunk, they might have reflected that so soon as
order had been restored to the colony, a general search
would be made, and they would not only be compelled
to disgorge their plunder, but the fact of stolen goods
being found in their possession would necessarily implicate
them as having taken part in the mutiny. But
the whole uprising was marked by the same utter
absence of forethought, and the same incomprehensible
indifference to inevitable consequences. If any pre-concerted
plan of action had originally existed, it was
certainly not acted upon, and to this fortunate circumstance
it is owing that all their intended victims escaped
with the exception of the captain of the garrison.</p>

<p>Towards three o'clock I was agreeably surprised by
the sudden appearance of the German steamer in the
offing, and I immediately began to make preparations
for leaving by her, as I supposed that the mutineers
would offer no objection to my taking my departure.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
My hopes were doomed to be disappointed, however.
When the steamer arrived abreast of the English
consul's house, which is situated about five miles
further up the straits, a little cutter put off from the
shore, evidently with the intention of acquainting the
people on board the steamer of the mutiny. I watched
with anxious eyes to see what the steamer would do.
Having parleyed for a while with the people in the
cutter, she moved slowly on again towards the colony.
Presently the boat of the captain of the port put off
from shore and went out to meet her. She had hardly
got alongside, when a sudden report was heard, and a
cannon-ball, fired from the fort, struck the water just
under the steamer's bows. It was quickly followed by
another, which fell rather wide of the mark. In the
meanwhile, the steamer got out of range as quickly as
she was able, and keeping well on the opposite side of
the straits, she soon passed the colony, and gradually
disappeared from sight, taking the boat of the captain of
the port with her.</p>

<p>It appeared that the latter had been manned by
several mutineers, who, disregarding the maxim anent
honour among thieves, had made off with their own and
their companions' share of certain moneys which had
been plundered from the military chest. They had
hoped to palm themselves off on the authorities on
board as peaceful citizens, who had made good their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
escape from the dangers of the revolt, but the captain
took the liberty of doubting their representations, and
put them all into irons. They were eventually brought
back to Sandy Point by an American man-of-war, which
met the German steamer a few days afterwards.</p>

<p>Partly from rage at having been duped by their
comrades, and partly from pure love of mischief, the
mutineers had endeavoured to shell the steamer, and
their first shot was very nearly attended with disastrous
success.</p>

<p>I consoled myself for the disappointment I had just
experienced, by the thought that the Pacific steamer
for Monte Video, the <i>Cotopaxi</i>, was due on the following
day, and I was determined that I would not miss
her in the same way. There was no other steamer after
her for another fortnight, and it would indeed be a
fatality if, after all the efforts I had made in order to
reach Sandy Point in time to take her, she should
actually pass by before my very eyes, without my
being able to go on board.</p>

<p>As it was possible that she might arrive at any
moment, I resolved to go immediately to the English
consul's house, in order to go on board with him, for I
did not doubt that he would put off to warn her not to
approach the colony.</p>

<p>Without losing any time, therefore, I started off with
Guillaume. On the way we met several bands of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
mutineers, who were in a very advanced state of
intoxication. They told us that they were going to set
fire to the town, and leave that night for the pampas;
but though they were always threatening to shoot one
another, they did not molest us in any way. I noticed
that they were all dressed in new clothes, and some
even had as many as three waistcoats on.</p>

<p>When I arrived at the English consul's house, I found
there was no one in it except the foreman of the sawmill,
a Scotchman, who had but recently arrived at the
colony, and who was by no means tranquil in his mind
as to the turn events had taken. He told me that Dr.
Dunsmuir, the consul, had gone off in his cutter to meet
the German steamer, but that he had not yet returned,
probably owing to a strong head-wind which was then
blowing. I remained, therefore, to await his coming,
and Guillaume went back to the colony, to see how
matters were going.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<p>I found McGregor, my new companion, in a state of
despondent dread lest a party of mutineers should
arrive from Sandy Point 'and murder us a'.' I endeavoured
to convince him that there was no danger, as
indeed I believed there was not; but he refused to be
comforted, and grew so gloomy at the thought of the
terrible fate in store for him, that at last I gravely said:
'Well, I see there is no use in hiding the truth from
you. We are in a most dangerous plight, and if bad
fortune does lead the soldiers here, we are as likely as
not to get our throats cut.' This lugubrious intimation
had the effect I anticipated. Feeling that nature
unaided was not strong enough to sustain him under the
present critical circumstances, McGregor applied himself
so assiduously to a jar of whisky that was fortunately
at hand, that in a very short time he became
quite cheerful, and even warlike, and sang 'Scots wha
ha'e wi' Wallace bled' with astonishing vigour and persistency,
till, yielding to the soft influences of his native
stimulant, he at last sank into that sweet, calm slumber
from which the awakening is 'hot coppers.'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile, evening came on apace, but no signs of the
consul, and I began to fear that he had been blown too
far out to sea to get back again that night. To pass
away the time, I inspected the house, which was one-storied,
and consisted of two large front rooms, a sitting-room,
and a bedroom, behind which were two smaller
compartments, one used as a larder, and the other as a
kitchen. From the back-door one had only to step out
to find one's self in a dense beech forest.</p>

<p>Just as it was getting dark, I heard the sound of
horses' hoofs, and Guillaume galloped up to the house,
breathless and excited. He told me that matters had
taken a very serious turn in the colony; the mutineers
had committed several acts of violence, and a general
massacre being apprehended, great numbers of the
colonists were flying to the woods. He himself had had
a very narrow escape. He had been seized by a party
of mutineers, who were making preparations for leaving
for the pampas, and who wished to requisition his services
as guide to Santa Cruz. All his remonstrances
were in vain, and they plainly intimated to him that he
had to choose between accompanying them and having
a bullet put through him; he was compelled, therefore,
to appear to assent. In order to gain time, he asked
that he might be allowed to go to Pedro's house to fetch
some clothes, and his request being granted, two soldiers
were sent with him to prevent any attempt he should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
make to escape. They were, fortunately, so drunk,
however, that they had hardly been a few minutes in
the house when they lay down and soon fell fast asleep.
Profiting by this lucky circumstance, Guillaume lost no
time in jumping on a horse which happened to stand in
Pedro's yard, and in a few seconds he placed himself
out of danger of pursuit.</p>

<p>All this news was the reverse of reassuring, and I
began to think that McGregor's fears were, after all, not
wholly unfounded. The consul's house was only a few
yards off the road which led from Sandy Point to the
Swiss colony at Agua Fresca, and at any time we might
expect an unpleasant visit from some of the soldiers,
who were continually going that way in search of horses
or plunder. To make matters worse, neither Guillaume
nor I had a revolver, and although we searched all over
the house, we could not find an arm of any description.
If attacked, therefore, we had no means of defending
ourselves&mdash;a consideration which did not tend to allay
our apprehensions.</p>

<p>After supper we made preparations for passing the
night. McGregor, who in the meantime had awakened,
made up a bed for himself on the floor; and although I
advised him not to, he would insist on taking off his
clothes. I lay down on a sofa to take a short nap,
pending the consul's arrival, which I hoped would not
now be long delayed. I soon fell asleep, but at about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
midnight I awoke, roused by the pattering of rain on
the roof. I got up and looked out at the weather. The
night was pitch-dark, and the rain was falling in torrents;
there was a stormy wind blowing, and I could
plainly hear the hoarse roar of the waves on the beach.
I went back to the sofa, but lay tossing about for a long
time, unable, tired as I was, to go to sleep again.</p>

<p>An hour went by, and I was just dozing off, when I
thought I heard a slight tap at the door. Hurriedly
lighting the lamp, I got up and looked out. Something
touched my hand, and looking down, I saw a little boy
standing close to me. His first words were:</p>

<p>'My mamma is waiting at the bottom of the garden,
and wants to know whether she may come in.'</p>

<p>'Certainly, my boy,' I said. 'But who is your
mother?'</p>

<p>'My father is the governor, and we have had to run
away from the town, for the soldiers are burning the
houses and killing everybody.'</p>

<p>With that he ran away into the rain and the darkness,
and came back after a second or two, followed by
a lady, with several children and two maid-servants.</p>

<p>I immediately took them into the bedroom, and
handed an armchair to Mrs. D&mdash;&mdash;, the governor's wife,
who was pale with exhaustion and suffering, and almost
in a fainting condition. As soon as she was sufficiently
rested to be able to speak, she told me that on the previous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
night, shortly after twelve o'clock, she had been
startled from her sleep by the discharge of cannon, with
which the mutineers had signalised the commencement
of the revolt. Her husband immediately rushed into
the street. He had hardly been gone two minutes, when
suddenly a hail of mitrailleuse bullets began to crash
through the house, riddling the very walls of her bedroom.
By a miracle, in the midst of this deadly fire, she
had time to collect all her children, and escape with
them unhurt into the street by a back-door. In a few
seconds more the house was in flames, and as she hurried
away, she could hear the jubilant shouts with which the
mutineers greeted the supposed successful slaughter of
her husband and his family. She managed to escape to
a little house on the beach, where she had remained
hidden during the day without having been detected.
But towards night the uproar and fighting amongst the
mutineers increased, several houses were set fire to, and
fearing that any moment a passing soldier might burst
into the house and discover her, as soon as it got dark
she had decided on attempting to reach the English consul's
house. By chance she had learned during the
daytime that her husband had escaped, and that in all
probability he had gone to fetch the Chilian man-of-war
<i>Magellanes</i>, now at Skyring Water, to put down the
revolt.</p>

<p>I told her that Mr. Dunsmuir would, in all probability,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
not be back that night, but that, in the meantime,
I should be glad to render her any assistance that
she might require.</p>

<p>The children, the eldest of whom was the little boy who
had come to the door first, and he was only seven, were
dressed in whatever clothes the servants had hurriedly
been able to snatch up on the night of the first alarm.</p>

<p>The poor things were in a terrible plight. They had
been more than two hours on the road from Sandy
Point, and were drenched to the skin with the rain and
mire. They had eaten nothing for twenty-four hours.
I took them in some tea; but rest being what they
chiefly required, with the help of mattresses and rugs,
etc., we managed to make some tolerably comfortable
beds for them. Having done this, we withdrew to the
sitting-room, there to consult as to our plan of action,
should the mutineers come to the house.</p>

<p>In the midst of the discussion, there was another
knock; and on the door being opened, two more fugitives
from the colony, an Irishman and his wife, made
their appearance. Both seemed to have had recourse
to strong stimulants to support their courage, and under
the circumstances they were certainly not a desirable
addition to our party.</p>

<p>During all this time McGregor had preserved a cheerful,
unconcerned demeanour. He had been particularly
active in his attentions to the D&mdash;&mdash; family, to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
extent of insisting, with well-meant but misplaced zeal,
that all should swallow a drop of whisky before going
to bed. He found the new-comers did not require so
much pressing.</p>

<p>Guillaume and I were sitting by the fire in the
kitchen, trying to get a little sleep, of which we were
sorely in need, when suddenly there was a loud banging
at the front-door, followed by a loud chorus of oaths and
vociferations. We immediately ran into the sitting-room,
and Guillaume went to open the door, whilst I
took the lamp into the kitchen. I had hardly put it down,
when I heard a crash in the front-room, the house was
filled with shrieks, and the Irish couple, McGregor, and,
as I thought, Guillaume, rushed madly past me into the
forest. Seized with the panic, I followed them for a
moment; but reflection returning, I went back to the
house, ashamed of my want of courage. I found half a
dozen drunken soldiers in the sitting-room, parleying with
Guillaume. Owing to the darkness, they had fortunately
not discovered the other room, where Mrs. D&mdash;&mdash; was
concealed; and in order to divert their attention from
it, we induced them to go into the kitchen. There we
plied them with more whisky, in the hopes of quickly
reducing them to a state of complete inebriety. The
transition phase was not a very pleasant one, inasmuch
as they never let go their carbines, and frequently, half
in joke, half in earnest, they pointed them threateningly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
at us. At times, too, they would wander into the
sitting-room, and then moments of terrible suspense
ensued for us, lest they should open the door of the
bedroom. We were careful always to follow them, and
had made up our minds, in the event of their attempting
anything of the kind, to suddenly throw ourselves upon
the two men nearest us, seize their carbines, which were
sixteen-repeating Winchesters, and open fire on the lot.
There was every chance in favour of the success of
such a measure, as the mutineers were already so drunk
that they could hardly stand, and if taken by surprise,
would have been too bewildered to offer any resistance.</p>

<p>The tension of these moments was heightened by the
probability that at any moment Mrs. D&mdash;&mdash;'s babies
might begin to cry, and thus reveal the secret of the
room. Miraculously enough, however, they kept quiet,
and we always managed to get the men back to the
kitchen without the dreaded crisis occurring. It seemed
as if they never would leave. Twenty times they got
to the front-door, and we began to breathe afresh, thinking
they were at last off; but twenty times, for some
reason or other, they would come back again. From
their conversation it was very hard to find out what
they exactly wanted. Those who were still sufficiently
sober to speak articulately, at times told us that they
were going to start off to the pampa immediately, and
at others that they intended holding the colony against
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
all comers. At one moment they would be maudlinly
affectionate; at another, they would lengthily discuss
which mode of killing us was preferable&mdash;shooting us
or cutting our throats. Of course we were always on
the alert, and ready to make good our objections to
either of these methods.</p>

<p>At last we had the indescribable satisfaction of seeing
them depart for good. Guillaume followed them at
some distance, to give the alarm in case they should
come back, whilst I ran to the bedroom to tell Mrs.
D&mdash;&mdash; that for the moment the danger was over.
What she must have suffered all this time may be
imagined. For two hours, every second of which must
have seemed an eternity to her, she had been expecting
to see the door burst open at any moment, and herself
and her children at the mercy of the mutineers, of
whose murderous intentions towards her she had had
terrible proof in the bombarding of her house on the
night of the commencement of the revolt. But her
courage had not given way, as it might well have done
under even less trying circumstances; and I found her,
though pale and prostrate, thoroughly calm and collected.
I hurriedly told her that at any moment the
mutineers might come back, and that we had better
leave the house, and fly to the woods.</p>

<p>We accordingly set out immediately. I took two of
the smaller children in my arms, the maids each carried
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
one, and the others walked by the side of their mother;
and Guillaume, who had returned after having seen the
soldiers safely off to the bottom of the garden, brought
up the rear, carrying a mattress and some rugs and
blankets. We then dived into the forest. It was still
raining, and the night was as dark as could be. At
every step we would meet with some mishap, now
stumbling over the fallen trunk of a tree, and now
slipping into some boggy hole. The children, who had
hitherto behaved admirably, having borne hunger and
cold and fatigue without a murmur, could now hardly
be kept from crying. I carried a little girl of about
four years old; her shoes and stockings had been lost
in the hurry of collecting the rugs and bedclothes, and
her uncovered feet were icily cold. But though I could
hear her sob now and then on my shoulder, she was too
brave to cry aloud. How the two babies lived through
all this exposure was a miracle.</p>

<p>After having walked for about half an hour, for we
could make but slow progress, we came to a spot which
seemed far enough from the house to be safe, and there
we spread out the two mattresses on the wet ground,
under the lea of the trunk of a fallen beech-tree. The
whole party managed to lie down on this rough bed,
and, having covered them over with the rugs and
blankets Guillaume had brought, we left them, to go
back to the house to fetch some provisions and some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
more coverings, for there was no knowing how many
days we might be compelled to pass in the woods.</p>

<p>We went very cautiously towards the house, as we
could hear voices in the kitchen, and feared lest the soldiers
might have returned already. The strains of
'Scots wha ha'e,' which pleasantly smote on our ears,
reassured us, however, and we went boldly forward.
We found that the Irish couple and McGregor had
returned. They were toasting their happy escape with
more whisky. McGregor was delighted to see that
we were still alive, and said he had run away at the
approach of the soldiers because 'I dinna speak Spanish,
ye ken.'</p>

<p>We were cold and exhausted with the night's exertions,
so whilst Guillaume went to see whether the
coast was clear, McGregor set about making coffee, and
I busied myself collecting provisions and other necessaries
for taking with us to the woods.</p>

<p>Guillaume soon came back, bringing three carbines,
which he had found at the bottom of the garden. From
the marks in the ground, he surmised that, under the
influence of their deep potations, the soldiers had probably
lain down to sleep there, and on awakening had
forgotten their arms. This was indeed a prize. Each
carbine still contained some six or seven charges. As
McGregor would have nothing to do with a weapon,
Guillaume and I kept one each, and hid the other away
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
in a bush near the house. As good luck, like bad,
seldom comes singly, whilst rummaging about the bedroom
in search of the little girl's stockings, I found a
revolver. This might prove a more valuable weapon
under certain circumstances than the carbine even,
and with it safe in my coat-pocket I felt quite a different
man.</p>

<p>We were just pouring out the coffee, having made all
preparations for finally leaving the house, when Guillaume,
who was always on the look-out, rushed suddenly
in, and shouting, 'Run for your lives!' seized me by the
arm, and dragged me out of the house. We had just
time to snatch up the carbines and dash into the woods,
when we heard the soldiers banging at the front-door.
We did not stop till we had got some distance into the
forest. Guillaume told me that there were about a
dozen soldiers, amongst whom, doubtless, the three
whose carbines he had taken. What they would do on
not finding them anywhere in the house, we did not
know, but it was not impossible that in their rage they
might set fire to the house, and perhaps follow us into
the woods. We now deeply regretted having tarried so
long in the house, as we had now no provisions to take
back to our charges. Whilst debating what to do, we
were startled by the sharp crack of a rifle, discharged
close to us, followed by the sound of approaching
voices; and fearing the soldiers were in pursuit of us,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
we hurried as fast as possible to where we had left
Mrs. D&mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>On reaching the spot, we found she had risen, anxious
on account of our long absence, and startled by
the shot she had just heard. Without saying that I
thought we were being followed, I told her that it was
perhaps better that we should go still further into the
forest, and, without losing a second, we gathered up
the children, and again commenced our pilgrimage,
plunging deeper and deeper into the dense mass of
underwood, till we had got so far that pursuit seemed
impossible.</p>

<p>By this time all the younger children were crying
bitterly for want of food. A tin of preserved milk,
which I had put in my pocket, had dropped out somehow,
and it now became almost a matter of life and
death that the babes should have some nourishment.
Feeling the urgency of the case, Guillaume and I again
started towards the house, hoping that the soldiers had
given up their search for us, and had perhaps gone back
to Sandy Point. We crept along with beating hearts,
starting at the crackling of the branches under our feet,
and fearing to find a foe concealed behind every tree, till
we at last got to the open near the house. Under cover
of some bushes, we crept close up to it. By the hum of
voices we could tell that the soldiers were still inside,
and presently one came out of the house and stood
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
peering into the wood for a short time, standing so close
to us that we could hear his breathing. After he had
gone inside, we profited by the opportunity to slip back
into the wood, and having made a circuit, we ensconced
ourselves on an eminence on the other side of the house,
where we were more secure, and where we could better
watch the coming and going of our enemies.</p>

<p>There we lay hour after hour, and still they did not
leave; they were in warm quarters, and the whisky was
doubtless too strong an attraction for them. What, I
began to think, if they should not leave all day? Our
only chance would be to steal into the house after dark,
and risk the rest. But it was doubtful whether the
younger children could live till then without some
nourishment. The tin of milk I had lost would have
saved all anxiety, and I half made up my mind to start
off and follow the path I had taken from the house to
the woods, on the desperate chance of perhaps finding it
again. Fortunately, matters did not reach that pitch,
for at last, after having impatiently waited for about
three hours, we saw ten or twelve soldiers leave the
house, mount their horses, and ride off in the direction
of Sandy Point. We immediately quitted our watchtower,
and ran as fast as we could towards the house;
but to our horror, just as we got to the door, we heard
voices within again. We were desperate by this time;
besides, it was too late to turn back, so, holding our guns
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
in readiness, we cautiously approached the doorway.
Then an anticlimax; for suddenly the Irishwoman, followed
by her spouse, rushed out and almost received
our fire.</p>

<p>On hearing Guillaume's shout of warning, they had
waited a moment too long, and before they could get
out of the place the soldiers were upon them. They
had furiously demanded the missing carbines, but of
course they were not to be found anywhere, whereupon
they threatened to burn the house down. Here again
the whisky saved the situation. They lingered so long
over the cask that they quite forgot to look for the
carbines, much less to go off in pursuit of us. Two or
three of them went a few yards into the wood, and fired
off a single shot at random, but they probably thought
it would be dangerous to risk themselves too far, and
they accordingly went back to their comrades. They
stayed as long as the whisky lasted, and then went off
again.</p>

<p>We lost no time in collecting a quantity of provisions,
tins of preserved meats and soups, milk, ham, eggs, etc.,
etc., to which I added some plates, saucepans, knives,
spoons&mdash;in fact, everything necessary for a prolonged
sojourn in the woods. I told McGregor to come with
us, if he liked, as to all appearance the mutineers
seemed in no hurry to leave for the pampas, and sooner
or later he might get into trouble. The Irish couple,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
having found a case of sherry, seemed to think their
lines cast in a very pleasant place, and as the soldiers
had as yet not done them any grievous harm, they made
up their minds to stay.</p>

<p>Loaded with the remaining blankets and with the
provisions, we made our way back as quickly as possible
to Mrs. D&mdash;&mdash;, who, as we had been away for
more than four hours, had become quite alarmed lest
some mishap had befallen us. We turned out the provisions,
soon made a fire, and having dissolved some
milk for the younger children, we commenced to prepare
a substantial meal, of which everyone stood in great
need. We were just beginning to feel a little more at
our ease, the children had been able to dry their clothes
and warm themselves by the fire, some meat we had
set to roast was nearly done to a turn, and, feeling
secure now from all danger, we were able for the first
time to quietly talk of the late events and discuss the
probability of the speedy arrival of the Chilian man-of-war&mdash;when
two women came running through the
woods towards us, pale and frightened, calling out as
they got near, "The soldiers, the soldiers! Run for
your lives!"</p>

<p>We all started to our feet in dismay. It was perhaps
already too late to fly. We were at all events armed,
and could at least make a good stand if necessary.
Meanwhile we hurriedly lifted the children in our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
arms, and leaving everything else behind us, we again
"moved on," turning our heads at every second, to be
prepared should the soldiers arrive. No one appeared,
however; and it seemed merely a false scare of the
women. The forest had become so dense that occasionally
we had to pick our way through thick underwood.
The ground was a mere swamp, full of treacherous holes,
and the rain and moisture clinging to the leaves of the
bushes drenched us all to the skin as we brushed
through them. But still we kept on, determined to
place such a distance between the road and our camp
as to leave us perfectly at ease as regards the mutineers,
who would certainly never take the trouble of looking
so far into the wood for anybody, even if they were to
stop another month round the colony.</p>

<p>When we reached a small open in the thicket, where
the ground was tolerably dry, we set down the children,
and returned on our tracks to fetch the mattresses,
coverings, and food we had left behind. We found
everything just as we had left it, and not a sign of
anyone having been near the place. The women who
had run past us had, perhaps, heard some branches
crackle, and had immediately concluded that the mutineers
were coming. However, there was nothing to be
done but to carry everything to our new camping-place&mdash;no
easy task, as both Guillaume and myself were
completely done up with our continued exertions, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
the mattresses and various other articles were in themselves
heavy enough.</p>

<p>We had hidden our charges so well that we could
not find them ourselves; and only after a great deal of
searching, quite by accident, we happened to stumble
on the place again. To keep off the wet, which was
dropping from the trees, we rigged up a kind of tent
over the mattresses with some blankets, and under its
shelter the whole party lay huddled together. We
then tried to make a fire, but as the wood was wet it
could not be got to burn, and only blinded us with
smoke. After a great deal of blowing, we at last succeeded
in raising a fair glow, by the aid of which we
managed to cook a meal, which was actually eaten.
And quite time it was, too, as the children had had
nothing but the milk for nearly forty-eight hours.</p>

<p>It was now about four o'clock. I became anxious to
know what was going on in the colony, and whether
there was any possibility of the mutineers leaving soon.
Leaving McGregor in charge of the camp, Guillaume
and I made our way down to the road, and keeping
under cover of the wood, slowly proceeded in the direction
of the colony, in the hopes of meeting some one
who could give us some news. We had not gone very
far when we saw a stout little man coming running
along the road at full speed. Guillaume recognised
him as one of the bakers at Sandy Point, and called to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
him to stop, as he ran past us. As soon as he could
find breath to speak, he said that a short time before
the house where he lived had been attacked by the
soldiers, two of his companions had been killed, and he
had only saved himself by jumping out of a window,
just as the mutineers were standing in the doorway of his
room, with fixed bayonets, inviting him to pass through
their midst. There was hardly anyone left in the colony,
most of the inhabitants having taken refuge in the woods.
He had seen several dead bodies lying about as he had
hurried away, but having never been out of his house
since the commencement of the revolt, he could give us
little information as to the doings of the mutineers.</p>

<p>We went back to the consul's house with him. The
Irishwoman was still there, and was sleeping peacefully
in an armchair; her husband we found lying in the
kitchen, with several severe head-wounds. A pillaging
party had evidently gone through the place, for drawers
were upset, crockery smashed, curtains torn down, and
general disorder prevalent everywhere. The baker was in
a hurry to be off to the woods, for after his recent narrow
escape he had a wholesome, but perhaps excessive, dread
of being suddenly seized by the mutineers again.</p>

<p>But though we had plenty of provisions of all kinds,
there was neither bread nor biscuit in the house, so I
asked him&mdash;flour, eggs, and butter being at hand&mdash;to
make the dough for some cakes, which could be baked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
up in the woods at our leisure. Very reluctantly he
agreed to do so, on condition that Guillaume should watch
the road, to give timely warning of the approach of
danger. Presently Guillaume called me, and on going
out I saw a dense cloud of smoke rising in the
direction of the colony. The convicts had evidently set
fire to the town, a prelude, perhaps, to their departure.
There was no wind, and soon a heavy downpour of rain
commenced; but we had little hope that a stick would
be left standing in the whole settlement, which was
built exclusively of timber. The dough being ready,
though I think it had not been kneaded very carefully,
we went back into the wood, losing our way as on the
former occasion; and had it not been for the familiar
strains of 'Scots wha ha'e!' with which McGregor was
cheering the children, and which at last guided us to
the camp, we might have wandered about for hours.</p>

<p>We were now quite a large party, the possibility of
being again disturbed by the mutineers was out of the
question; and if only we had been able to make a good
blazing fire, than which there is nothing so cheering to
the spirits, we might, comparatively speaking, have felt
fairly comfortable. But whatever wood we could collect
was quite wet, and it was difficult to get it to burn
sufficiently to cook the dinner by.</p>

<p>Under shelter of the improvised tent we had managed
to rig up, and with the aid of the few coverings procured
from the consul's house, Mrs. D&mdash;&mdash; and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
children were fortunately kept tolerably dry and warm,
and overcome with the anxieties and exertions of the
day, they were able to forget their troubles in sleep. As
for myself and the other men, we tried for some time
to do likewise, but having no coverings, the cold and
wet effectually kept us awake, and we passed the night
huddled round the smouldering logs, listening to the
monotonous pattering of the rain on the canopy of leaves
above us, and longing wearily for the morning.</p>

<p>It broke at last, and with it came better weather. As
soon as the sun was well up, I went down to the house
to see if there was anything new. On reaching a point
from which the settlement was visible, from the changed
aspect of the town, it was evident that the fire had
done great ravages. It was, however, too far off for me
to recognise whether many of the houses were left
standing, which, considering the nature of their construction,
was not probable. A thin column of smoke
was still rising from one part, but the fire itself seemed
spent. I then looked down the straits towards Dawson's
Island, but as yet there was no sign of any coming
steamer. The Pacific steamer <i>Cotopaxi</i> was due on the
day before, and as it is very unusual for the vessels of
that line to be behind time, I concluded that she had been
met by the English consul, and was possibly awaiting
the arrival of the Chilian man-of-war, whose coming could
not now be long delayed, before approaching the colony.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span></p>

<p>On my way back to our forest sanctuary, I stumbled
on a knot of Chilian women, who told me they had
escaped from the colony the previous night, for fear of
being taken to the pampas by the mutineers, who were
making preparations for leaving immediately. They all
had big bundles of clothes with them, and, strange to
say, all wore brand-new shawls and gowns. I had not
the slightest doubt but that they had done their share
in the general plundering. It was good news, at all
events, to hear that the mutineers were at last really off,
of which the burning of the colony was the best proof.</p>

<p>After breakfast I started off with Guillaume, with the
intention of going to Sandy Point, if possible, and discovering
the real state of affairs there. But on reaching
the road just below the consul's house, to our surprise
we found it thronged with fugitives from the settlement,
who were issuing from all parts of the woods, where
they had been hiding. On looking seawards, the reason
became apparent. Steaming along at full speed, and
already nearly opposite the house, we saw the long-expected
<i>Magellanes</i>, the Chilian man-of-war. I
immediately ran back to take the welcome news to Mrs.
D&mdash;&mdash;, that her troubles were now over. For the last
time we carried the children through the wood down to
Mr. Dunsmuir's house, which, by the time we got there,
was crowded with women and children, carrying such of
their household goods as they had been able to take
with them in their flight.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span></p>

<p>As soon as the <i>Magellanes</i> arrived in front of the
house, a boat was sent off to the shore, in which Mrs.
D&mdash;&mdash; and her children embarked to meet her husband,
who was safe on board. Shortly after, another larger
boat came to fetch off the other women and children.</p>

<p>Here a rather ludicrous scene ensued. Just before
the boat touched land, the people on shore were suddenly
seized with panic at the sight of some dark bodies
advancing on the road from Sandy Point, and which
they thought were the soldiers coming towards them.
Immediately the air was filled with shrieks, and, throwing
down their bundles, they all rushed into the water
to meet the advancing boat. The sailors had to keep
them off with their oars, or they would have swamped
the boat. Meanwhile, the foe came nearer, the shrieks
grew louder, some of the men even sharing in the general
weakness, till at last the coming squadron of horsemen
resolved itself into a herd of cows, who came trotting
leisurely down the road, ignorant of the panic their presence
had created.</p>

<p>The women and those of the men who chose to go
were at last brought safely on board, and the <i>Magellanes</i>
steamed slowly up the straits towards the colony.
Guillaume and I had already started off some time
before, and we arrived at the first house in the settlement
almost as soon as she arrived abreast of the pier.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>

<p>As we got nearer to the town it became evident that the
better portion had been burned down; of the fort, the
hospital, the Government buildings, and a great many
private houses, nothing remained but a smoking heap of
charred timbers. The first house I entered was Pedro's&mdash;the
one in which I had slept on the night of my
arrival. The state of things inside was deplorable; the
shop had been completely ransacked of its contents, the
taps of the casks had been turned on, and the wine and
aguadiente had run out on the floor, which was strewn
with the <i>dÃ©bris</i> of crockery and glassware, broken
bottles, half-emptied tins of preserved meats, odd boots,
wearing apparel, rice and flour&mdash;the remains, in fact, of
what had once constituted Pedro's stock-in-trade. The
other rooms bore marks of the same spirit of wanton
destruction. Everything smashable had been smashed,
and everything conveniently portable had been carried
off. The pillaging had been done with remarkable
thoroughness&mdash;no article seemed to have been too insignificant
to escape the rapacity of the marauders, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
had thought it worth while to take the cruet-stand, the
clock, and the knives and forks of ordinary household
use even.</p>

<p>Opposite Pedro's was the baker's house, which had
been stormed by the mutineers, the owner having unwisely
closed his doors and refused them admission.
They killed two of its inmates, and the others had a
narrow escape from sharing the same fate, just managing
to take flight unhurt under a shower of bullets. Walking
down to the plaza, I passed several dead bodies,
chiefly of convicts or soldiers. The streets were as yet
almost completely deserted, but on turning a corner I
found myself face to face with a villainous-looking man,
who, on seeing me, suddenly pointed his gun at me, and
for a second I thought he was going to fire. He lowered
his weapon immediately, however, saying that he had
taken me for a mutineer.</p>

<p>I had not the slightest doubt that he was one. In
fact, not a few of those who took a very active part in
the mutiny remained behind in Sandy Point when their
companions left for the pampas, either because they
were too drunk to be able to follow them, or because
they calculated on being able to pass themselves off on
the authorities as peaceful and inoffensive citizens, and
thus escape the punishment they had so well deserved.
Hence the officious zeal with which this man had felt
himself called upon to offer to shoot me, in the hopes of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
impressing me with his profound sympathies for the
cause of order.</p>

<p>In the meantime, some forces were landed from the
<i>Magellanes</i>, and gradually the colonists began to flock
down to the town from all parts of the woods, or from
wherever they had been hiding during the revolt.
Many came back to find their houses burned to the
ground; and there were few who were not completely
ruined by the wholesale and wanton destruction of their
property.</p>

<p>It was estimated that damage to the amount of about
$500,000 had been done&mdash;a very large sum indeed, considering
the size of the town and the calling of its
inhabitants. About sixty persons perished during the
revolt, and several died subsequently from the effects of
their wounds. Strange to say, the day after the mutineers
left Sandy Point, no less than three men-of-war
lay anchored in the straits in front of the town. Amongst
them was a United States steamer, which had been
warned by the German packet of the mutiny, and which,
but for the heavy weather encountered off Cape Virgines,
might have arrived at the colony on Tuesday morning,
and have quelled the revolt before it had developed its
worst features.</p>

<p>The mutineers had chosen a favourable moment for
their rising. Most of the colonists were away seal-fishing,
and the man-of-war generally stationed in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
straits was temporarily absent from Sandy Point, being
engaged on a survey of Skyring Water. The nominal
head of the mutineers was a sergeant of the name of
Riquelmes. Their plan had originally been to kill the
governor and any of the Government officials obnoxious
to them, and then immediately set out for the pampas,
and cross the Santa Cruz River into Argentine territory,
where these naÃ¯ve scoundrels imagined they would be
hailed as an acquisition, and be received with open
arms by the authorities. On a par with such absurd
reasoning was their conduct throughout the revolt, and
when they left Sandy Point they loaded their pack-horses
with bales of shawls, dresses, ponchos, and
similar useless articles, but with not an ounce of provisions
of any kind.</p>

<p>Riquelmes, as I have said, was their nominal chief,
but he dared not, had he wished to, enforce his authority,
and each mutineer plundered or murdered at his
own sweet will, without reference to the doings of his
comrades. Owing to this absence of organisation, their
intended victims, with the exception of the captain of
the garrison, were fortunately able to escape. The
governor, Major D&mdash;&mdash;, on hearing the first alarm, had
run into the streets. A passing soldier, without recognising
him, struck him over the head with a gun, and
he fell senseless. When he recovered, aided by the
darkness, he managed to reach a house on the outskirts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
of the town, where he was well received and enabled
to dress his wound. He then procured a horse, and
after an unbroken ride of twenty-three hours, arrived
at Skyring Water just in time to catch the <i>Magellanes</i>,
which was getting up steam preparatory to leaving, and
apprise the captain of the mutiny. The captain of the
garrison, less fortunate, was murdered as he was leaving
his bedroom, and his dead body was barbarously
mutilated before the eyes of his wife and children. The
other officials escaped.</p>

<p>During the two ensuing days the mutineers were
chiefly occupied in drinking and plundering&mdash;pastimes
which they varied with occasional fights among themselves.
On the first day they had respected the lives
and persons of the colonists, and many of the latter,
foreseeing that this moderation might not be of long
duration, wisely withdrew from the town and hid themselves
in the woods, with their wives and children.
Those who remained behind, in the hopes of being able
to save their homes and property from destruction, soon
had cause to regret their imprudence. The conduct of
the mutineers, in measure as the effects of the continued
drinking in which they indulged began to tell upon
them, grew more and more violent, and before long,
breaking all bounds, they gave themselves up to the
most ferocious licence. It is not necessary to recount
the details of the horrible scenes that took place; as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
may be imagined, given the antecedents of these men,
human life was of as little account with them as female
honour. Though there was nothing to be gained by it,
they seemed to find a peculiar satisfaction in destroying
everything that was destructible, and it was not from
any want of intention that the whole colony was not
burned to the ground by them, but simply that they were
too intoxicated to be able to carry out the necessary
arrangements for so doing with sufficient thoroughness.</p>

<p>In the midst of their orgies they were surprised by
the appearance of the <i>Magellanes</i> early on Wednesday
morning. Thereupon they hurriedly collected some
forty horses, which they loaded with all kinds of
plunder, but forgetting, as I have already said, incredible
though it may seem, to take any provisions with
them; and the whole crowd, which numbered about
180 souls, including some women, then started off for
Cabo Negro on foot. At that place they expected to
find sufficient horses to mount everybody, as most of
the horses belonging to the colonists were kept there,
on account of there being little or no pasturage in the
vicinity of Sandy Point. In this expectation, however,
they were disappointed&mdash;the farm-owner had taken the
precaution of driving the whole of his stock out of
harm's way, and the mutineers, on arriving at Cabo
Negro, found themselves obliged to abandon the useless
plunder they had brought from the colony, for most of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
them were already tired out, and required the few horses
they possessed for more practical purposes than that of
carrying bales of guanaco mantles and dry goods. As
many as three men had to ride on each horse, and even
then a great number had to drag themselves along on
foot as best they might. The whole band, therefore,
moved very slowly, and they were, moreover, under
continual dread of the arrival of a pursuing party from
the colony.</p>

<p>For some reason known only to those having authority,
no such party was despatched, however; though
there is little doubt that forty or fifty men, well armed
and well mounted, might easily have brought the mutineers
to bay, and effected their capture without much
trouble. Many had already thrown their guns and
ammunition away, and now that they were brought face
to face with almost certain starvation, would have been
glad to surrender on any terms.</p>

<p>In the evening, though they could ill spare them,
they had to kill two or three horses for food. The next
day they fell in with an ostrich-hunter, who, not knowing
what had taken place during his absence, was quietly
returning to Sandy Point. His troop of horses was, of
course, an invaluable prize to the mutineers, and him
they forced to go with them, in order that with his dogs
he might help to supply them with food. He contrived
to lag behind the main band, however, and when once
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
fairly amongst the foot-stragglers, he suddenly turned
round, and, galloping away, made good his escape, unpursued
by the mutineers, who had no inclination to
tire their horses unnecessarily.</p>

<p>They now conceived the plan of surprising the Indians,
with the object of massacring them and seizing their
horses and dogs, but unforeseen circumstances again
transpired to frustrate their intentions. Five or six
mutineers had left Sandy Point on the first day of the
mutiny, and these men, on passing through the Indian
encampment, besides stealing several horses, had killed
an Indian who had remonstrated with them. This incident
put the Indians on the alert; they despatched
scouts in all directions, and as soon as these latter
announced the coming of the main band, the camp was
hurriedly broken up, and long before the mutineers
arrived at Campo de Batalla, the site of the encampment,
the Indians were half-way to the Cordilleras, and
far out of reach of pursuit.</p>

<p>The day after their last disappointment poor Isidoro
fell into their hands. He had crossed the Gallegos,
which in the meantime had fallen considerably, two days
before, and was travelling leisurely towards Sandy Point,
little dreaming of what was in store for him, when one
evening, on turning a bend in some caÃ±on, he suddenly
stumbled on the mutineers' camp. He was immediately
surrounded, dragged from his horse, and taken to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
Riquelmes, who, without saying why or wherefore,
ordered him to prepare to be shot within five minutes.
Any attempt at resistance was, of course, useless, and
Isidoro quietly resigned himself to his fate. Ten men
were told off to do the fatal office, and Riquelmes was
just going to give the command to fire, when it suddenly
occurred to him that Isidoro might be useful for tracking
the Indians, to find whom the mutineers still thought
it was possible, and accordingly he agreed to spare
Isidoro's life, warning him that, should he attempt to
escape, he would be punished with immediate death.</p>

<p>The next day they continued their march. Isidoro,
surrounded by a strong guard, was allowed to ride on
horseback, his other horses, twenty-seven in number,
being of course requisitioned by the mutineers. During
the first day no opportunity to escape presented itself,
but on the second day such an occasion occurred, and
Isidoro adroitly profited by it. In the course of the
march some specks were observed moving about on the
horizon, which Riquelmes and his followers fancied must
be the Indians; and appeal being made to Isidoro, he
confirmed their supposition, although his own superior
power of vision enabled him to detect that the specks
in question were nothing but guanacos. Whereupon
ensued great excitement. A halt was immediately made,
and a council of war held, with the object of determining
some ruse by means of which to obtain the Indians'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
horses. After everybody had spoken, Isidoro offered to
decoy the Indians into the hands of the mutineers on
condition that, in the event of his being successful, his
own horses should be returned to him, and he should be
allowed to go back to Sandy Point.</p>

<p>Isidoro was well known to most of the mutineers by
reputation as a man of great craft and adroitness, and as
they had no doubt of his ability to be as good as his
word, his offer was eagerly accepted. He then explained
that in the first place it was necessary, before maturing
his plans, that he should reconnoitre the Indian camp,
and in order not to arouse the suspicions of Riquelmes,
he requested that two men should be sent to accompany
him. Of these two he had no doubt that he would be
able to dispose in some way or other, as soon as he had
got a safe distance from the main band, as, strange to
say, his capturers had neglected to take his revolver
from him. The rest of his escape he left to Providence
and his good horse.</p>

<p>But Fate was willing to make matters easier for him
than he anticipated. Riquelmes was completely taken
in by this little artifice, and, fearing lest the sight of the
Chilians should awaken mistrust in the minds of the
Indians, he suggested that Isidoro should go alone.</p>

<p>Five minutes afterwards Isidoro was leisurely cantering
over the plain in the direction of the mysterious
specks, to whose timely appearance he owed his sudden
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
release. After he had gone about two miles, the plain
was crossed by a deep caÃ±on. Into this he descended,
disappearing, of course, from view of the mutineers,
who expected to see him shortly emerge again on the
opposite side. How long they watched for his reappearance
is neither here nor there, but after a certain
lapse of time it no doubt gradually began to dawn upon
them that they had been guilty of considerable simplicity,
and that in all probability they would never
see Isidoro again.</p>

<p>As for him, the moment he reached the bottom of the
caÃ±on, he clapped spurs to his horse, and followed its
windings at breakneck speed till night-fall, and then,
after a short rest, he rode up on the plain, and commenced
travelling southwards again, so that by daybreak
he was many miles behind the mutineers, and
perfectly secure from any chance of being pursued.
He was, of course, happy to escape with his life, but all
his horses being lost, he was now a poor man; his
prediction as to the unfortunate issue to his trip,
which he had made on losing his whip in crossing the
Santa Cruz, was thus strangely verified. It was providential,
after all, that Guillaume and I had crossed the
Gallegos when we did; for we should otherwise have
doubtless been taken prisoners by the mutineers, together
with Isidoro, and being <i>bouches inutiles</i>, they
would probably have shot us.</p>

<p>The mutineers slowly worked their way northwards,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
their numbers being thinned by the fatal disputes,
which were of frequent occurrence. The horseless
stragglers, too, unable to keep up with the main body,
gradually died off from starvation and exposure, and
finally, in the month of February, an expedition sent to
the Patagonian coast by the Argentine Government,
captured all that remained of the band, in the persons
of about forty half-starved wretches, who were found
wandering about the country somewhere in the vicinity
of Port Desire. They were taken up to Buenos Ayres,
and some difficulty as to their extradition having arisen
between the Chilian and the Argentine Governments,
they are still in prison in that city. The most culpable
of the band taken prisoners by the <i>Magellanes</i>
were shot at Sandy Point, March, 1879, and the others
were condemned to various periods of penal servitude.</p>

<hr class="l30" />

<p>I was leaning over the bulwarks of the steamer which
was bearing me rapidly out of the straits back to the
noisy work-a-day world. I had come up on deck to
have a last look at Patagonia, for we were nearing Cape
Virgines, and should now soon lose sight of land altogether.
Darkness was coming on apace, cold gusts of
wind ploughed up the foaming water, and the clouded
sky looked gloomy and threatening. The mainland,
half shrouded in a thick white fog, frowned sullenly
down upon us as we swept past; and the dull muffled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
roar of the sea on the stony beach, which at intervals
struck dismally on my ear, sounded like a half-suppressed
growl with which the genius of the solitudes
I was now leaving bade me good speed.</p>

<p>'Well,' said a friend at my elbow, 'I suppose you
would not care to go to Patagonia again?'</p>

<p>I glanced at the scene before me, and as certain unpleasant
memories which it called forth passed through
my mind, I answered, shuddering, and with decided
emphasis, 'By Jove, no!'</p>

<p>Perhaps, had the day been fine, the sea smooth, the
sky cloudless and blue, and the green slopes of the mainland
bright with cheering sunshine, my answer might not
have been so uncompromisingly in the negative. Forgetting
minor inconveniences, I might have remembered
only the pleasant features of my sojourn in the pampas,
the rough simplicity of my everyday life, the frank
kindness of my unconventional companions, the delights
of the chase, the glorious gallops over immensity, with
the pure exhilarating air of the desert rushing into my
lungs and making my whole being glow with intense
animation, the cheerful gathering round the warm campfire
after the day's hard work, the hearty supper, the
fragrant pipe, and then the sweet sleep in the open air,
with the stars shining into my dreams.</p>

<p class="descrip">Or, Memories of a New England Year. By <span class="smcap">W. Hamilton Gibson</span>.
With 76 Illustrations in the highest style of Wood Engraving.</p>

<p>"<i>The volume contains a prose poem, with illustrations in the shape of wood
engravings more beautiful than it can well enter into the hearts of most men to
conceive. Mr. Gibson is not only the author of the text, he is the designer of the
illustrations: and it would be difficult to say in which capacity he shows most of
the true poet. There is a sensuous beauty in his prose which charms and lulls
you.... But, as the illustrations are turned to, it will be felt that a new
pleasure has been found. It would be difficult to express too high admiration of
the exquisite delicacy of most of the engravings. They are proofs at once of Mr.
Gibson's power as an artist, of the skill of the engravers, and of the marvellous
excellence of the printer's work.</i>"&mdash;<span class="smcap">Scotsman.</span></p>

<p>"<i>Mr. Thornbury knew and loved his London.... He had read much history,
and every by-lane and every court had associations for him. His memory
and his note-books were stored with anecdote, and, as he had singular skill in the
matter of narration, it will be readily believed that when he took to writing a set
book about the places he knew and cared for, the said book would be charming.
Charming the volume before us certainly is. It may be begun in the beginning, or
middle, or end, it is all one: wherever one lights, there is some pleasant and curious
bit of gossip, some amusing fragment of allusion or quotation.</i>"&mdash;<span class="smcap">Vanity Fair.</span></p>

in simple style the phenomena and laws of heat. No strength is vainly spent in
endeavouring to present a mathematical view of the subject. The author passes
over the ordinary range of matter to be found in most elementary treatises on
heat, and enlarges upon the applications of the principles of his science&mdash;a subject
which is naturally attractive to the uninitiated. Mr. Williams's object has been
well carried out, and his little book may be recommended to those who care to study
this interesting branch of physics.</i>"&mdash;<span class="smcap">Popular Science Review.</span></p>
